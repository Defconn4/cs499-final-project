Sources for grabbing lyrics:
    1) https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1 - using Genius API for grabbing lyric information.

Sources for using GPT-2 Model (Hugging Face):
    1) https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2
    2) https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/inserting-text - OpenAI GPT-3 model documentation/use

Sources for similar implementations of rap lyric text generation:
