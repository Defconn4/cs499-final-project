WITHOUT YOU Lyrics[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Verse]
I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally

Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

And even harder to let you go
I really wish that we, could have got this right

But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

TELL ME WHY Lyrics[Intro]
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, shit, yeah, yeah)
Late night, thinkin' of shit, um (Yeah)
(Tell me why)
Tell me why, tell me why
It's so hard to say goodbyes
Tell me why, tell me why
(No, no, no, no)
Oh, shit, let's go (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)
And when I get inside of my mind, I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah
[Verse 1]
Lost too many people to this shit, can't even speak upon this shit
I seen shit, I'm way too damn young, it shouldn't need to be like this
I swear that I'm way too damn numb to even think about this shit
But when it's late and I lay awake, I get to tweakin' in this bitch
Overthinkin', overdrinkin' Hennessy up in this bitch
And I'ma face another 'wood 'til I can't think up in this bitch
'Cause if I keep thinking 'bout our memories
Then it's gon' be in memory of me

[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)

[Verse 2]
I can't count all the tears I cried, so many sleepless nights
Watched all of my idols die, right in front of my eyes
She asked why my heart so cold, and I just can't even lie
I think that I'm better off, without you with me tonight
Better off alone, 'cause I won't take it well if
You come in my life, just to go like the rest did
Why the fuck does God keep testin' me?
Put my heart to bed, let it rest in pieces
[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah

[Outro]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah73Embed

It's the last time I let you hurt me
Fuck you, goodbye, I did not deserve it
None of this bullshit was ever really worth it
You blame me like I know I ain't perfect
I tried with you, and I lied for you
Many times, put my life on the line for you
I really wanted to get it right with you
I always saw the better side of you
And now it's fuck you for life

You brought the dark to my light
I'm with a new one tonight
But there is one last thing I want to tell you tonight

Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Wait, that was a lie
Because I cannot erase you like eternal sunshine in a spotless mind
Red in the eyes, lately I've been on a cocaine diet
I've been tryin' to feed my high
Your things are still in the box that you left in the bedroom
You'll leave, and I'm here
With no heart, guess I'll be dead soon
Ghost in a shell, stoned like a cemetery
Scars don't heal, I got these in February
Broke your spell, love is only temporary
Highway to hell, I'm hangin' out the roof, yellin'

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, Machine Gun Kelly & Both]
Fuck you, goodbye (Yeah)
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on

SO DONE Lyrics[Intro]
Okay, I realize now, that everything that I did was wrong
Okay, I realize now, some things are better off said than done
Okay, I realize now, that maybe I'm not ready for love
Okay, I realize now, I finished us before we begun-un-un

That I'm not gon' be here forever but I
Wish that I was, but you were the cause
For every lil' feelin' I'm feeling inside
Sometimes I sit and I think about why
I even trusted you, shit, I'm surprised
I'm walkin' away from you, it's about time
Want you to walk out and walk out of my life
And you, yeah, you (Yeah, you)
You stay on my mind way more than I would like for you to
And you, yeah, you
The reason I can't find no love, don't wanna find no one

NOT FAIR Lyrics[Intro: Corbin]
I can't cum unless you kiss me
I don't know her, but she saying that she miss me
Rolling with that 450
Why they wanna send me under, fucking six feet?
I cope how they want, yeah, I keep the safe off
Never out in public 'cause they talk
Got a taste and got shell-shocked
Drive me to Hell in a drop-top

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Uh, drive me to Hell in a drop-top
I need you to save me 'fore I fuck up and go too far
I hate that you blame me for the things that I cannot control
I'm out here tryna make it work for us, it's too much
On my plate, got it all at stake
Say you hate me now, but you're at my place
Tell me lies, tell me that it's all okay
Tell me why you love me, even if it's fake
[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Corbin]
It's not fair
No matter what, I'm still gon' be here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Crash and burn, Princess Diana
Better off, better off dead
You don't wanna come around here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Don't wanna be myself, I'm too scared
Yeah-yeah, I'm too scared

[Verse 2: Corbin]
Even if it isn't real, I wanna hear it (Oh, Oh)
Pour my heart out on the floor and now it's leaking (Oh, Oh)

I don't care if it was all pretend, I wanna feel it

M.O.B. 'cause if I lose it all, you leavin'
Bitch, you don't love me, that's a lie, I don't believe it (Nah, nah)

I don't wanna hear it anymore if you don't mean it
(I don't want, I don't want) Don't wanna fall too deep
Trust issues, it's too hard to give you all of me
Love isn't what you see and what you want it to be
I want you, but I just can't give you all of me
[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Corbin]
It's not fair
No matter what, I'm still gon' be here

Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I’m not sober

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
They tryna bring me down, gotta stay focused
When I get sad, I get the Hennessy and pour up
Fuck dirty Sprite, I get the liquor and the cola
And fuck my ex bitch, she did me dirty, I got no trust
I was only young, but I learned that these hoes ain't shit
I gave you my all, and this the thanks I get?
I still can’t believe all of the things I did
I still can't believe that you would leave like this
Traumatized from the shit I've seen in my life
Everything you see right now is the highlight
And no matter how hard I try
Memories still living deep in my mind
I've seen my best friends change colors like a tie-dye
But shout out to the ones that still with me, those are my guys
And fuck everybody else that's just talking from the sidelines
Seeing it and living it, bitch, there is a fine line
And R.I.P. my brother, never got to say bye-bye
It gets hard, I know, believe it
I hope you find the help you're seeking
I was down in Hell, believe me
Packed up my bags and told the Devil, "I'm leaving"
[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I’m not sober

[Verse 2: Polo G]
Okay, hold up, I can’t fold up
Be so sick, you lose a soldier, wanna throw up
I kept seein' all your pictures every time I scroll up
Now when we see a nigga, get him, quick to let that pole bust
Cali cruisin’ in that i8 with the doors up
Now we winnin', 'member back then, they never chose us
Now them bitches doin' backbends, givin’ throat up
And I keep collectin' backends 'cause they owed us
I was really tryna find a way up in them streets lost
Don't be in my feelings really, I just be in deep thoughts
And it been fuck the opposites, no, we don't do the peace talk
Foenem come through rockin' shit, and that's another beat caught

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
[Verse 3: Stunna Gambino]
I get lost up in my feelings in this Wraith, so I just look at the stars
Like, "Goddamn, we done made it this far"
This shit a blessing, nigga
'Cause I remember we was broke, they weren't messin' with us
I had to make my own way, I manifested, nigga
I dropped two-fifty on a Urus, ain't no Tesla, nigga
And it's still fuck the opps, I just don't be addressin' niggas
The feds screamin' out indictments, they collectin' niggas, mmm
Left me heartless, but I'm glad that it's over
No more cryin' on my shoulder
Pour up the Hennessy 'cause I hate bein' sober, mmm

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober16Embed

STILL CHOSE YOU Lyrics[Intro: Jorja Smith & YG]
I can see your face, see the light in your eyes
I can see the change, feel the heat of the fire
If you can feel the pain, then you know you're alive
Both feet on the line, by any means, I will—
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Here I am, here I am, here I am
I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again
Know I said I wouldn't, but look at where I am
I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
All of these hoes and I still chose you
With all that I want and I still want you, oh
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh)
All of these hoes and I still chose you
With all that I want and I still want you, oh
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do, oh
[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
That's what I promised I was never gon' do
I said, "Fuck love" 'fore I ever met you (Oh, yeah)
Three different girls in a day, I'm ashamed
But with all that I've been through, girl, who could you blame? Oh
Trust issues, I still got 'em
That's why I'm always tweakin' with you on some lil' problems
And you know it's different for me, I came out the real bottom
Why the fuck you stressin' on me? You know I got real problems

[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Here I am, here I am, here I am (Oh)
I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again
Know I said I wouldn't, but look at where I am
I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did (Oh-oh)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
All of these hoes and I still chose you
With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Oh, oh)
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (No, no)
All of these hoes and I still chose you (Woah)
With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Want you, oh)
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Never gon do, oh)
[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
You know, out of anyone, that it's hard for me to show my love
Hope you don't go to everyone
Tell 'em everything that I tell you, no
Oh, 'cause I'm so sure 'bout you
I hope I'm not wrong
I know where this is headed 'cause I've been here before
But I can't blame nobody but me, it's my fault (Oh)
I should've known I wasn't ready to fall in love again

[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Here I am, here I am, here I am
I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again (Fell in love again)
Know I said I wouldn't, but look at where I am
I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did (Love)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
All of these hoes and I still chose you
With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Woah)
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you (No)
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh)
All of these hoes and I still chose you (Chose)
With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Woah, oh, oh)
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you (You)
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do

Both feet on the line, by any means, I will—17Embed

MAYBE Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drown my sorrows in this bottle
Won't like wakin' up tomorrow
I'm the only one that cares about myself
And you don't need me like I need you
So if I go, maybe I'll free you
But I'll be lost, to tell the truth, I need your help
And even you can't fix my problems
Like you once did, I'm too hollow
I can't talk to you no more and I can't tell
If it's me or if it's you, 'cause
You don't even pick up my calls no more
I'm drunk and left alone with all my thoughts

[Chorus]
So maybe, maybe I'm drivin' me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up
But maybe, maybe it's you who can save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
So maybe there's no way to change me
So maybe, maybe I'm drivin' me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up
But maybe, maybe it's you who could save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
So maybe there's no way to change me, yeah
[Verse 2]
No way that I'll ever change
So I'm down to lay down next to my brain
I said I'm okay, but no way
It's more than I can take
And there's no one to blame but me
No need to wait for me
Why do you pick me up just to break me?
That's what you say to me
Why do you play with me?
You won't ever understand

[Chorus]
So maybe, maybe I'm drivin' me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up
But maybe, maybe it's you who can save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
So maybe there's no way to change me
So maybe, maybe I'm drivin' me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up
But maybe, maybe it's you who could save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
So maybe there's no way to change me24Embed

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
I hope you know what you did to me
I'm grateful for what you did for me
You showed me that you ain't shit and these bitches is dangerous
Now I do 'em just how you did to me
And I know you see the pain in my eyes, every secret and lie
Got a reason to cry 'fore I sleep at night
I need my peace of mind, I see you fine
But I'm far from that, so—
[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Now I'ma be savage, but you made it happen
And you made a habit (I get it now)
I wonder what happened
I thought we would last 'til we turn into ashes
Burnin' and crashin'
Why can't I get past it? (Why can't I get past?)
Damn, girl, you changed up the best one
I just feel sorry for my next one

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
'Cause I'ma be selfish, I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be selfish, I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be—

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
Bad, bad, bad
Because I just can't do this again
Don't wanna feel like this again
So she has to
Now I'm up in LA, I'm with a bitch from the Bay
I'm tellin' her that I love her, but my feelings are fake (Oh woah, woah)
Because I'll find another and I'll tell her the same
Knowin' that I don't mean a thing I say (Say)
[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Now I'ma be savage, but you made it happen
And you made a habit (I get it now)
I wonder what happened
I thought we would last 'til we turn into ashes

Why can't I get past it? (Why can't I get past?)
Damn, girl, you changed up the best one
I just feel sorry for my next one

'Cause I'ma be selfish, I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be selfish, I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be—

NEED YOU MOST (So Sick) Lyrics[Verse 1]
We fight every day and night
You want me to make the time
You always get mad and say what you coulda had
And that you want me to make it right, uh
I couldn't do that to save my life
You always tell me you ain't surprised
You said it's the last time, I guess that you were right
'Cause I'ma do one with you tonight

[Chorus]
And now I'm so sick of these love songs, so sad and slow
And I'm so sick of wishin' I had you on my own
And oh, baby, I've been fucked up ever since you've been gone
I can't bring myself to even pick up my phone
I need you the most, I need you the most
I need you the most, I need you the most, I need you the most
[Verse 2]
I ain't gon' lie, oh, baby I've been fucked up
I said I was sorry for all of the times I fucked up
Fuck love, got me thinkin' while I pour my cup up
Tonight is in memory of you, I'm gettin' fucked up
Oh, just one more chance to make it right
Promise I got you, so tell me what's up?
I don't think that I can keep goin' this way
I can't take it

[Chorus]
Now I'm so sick of these love songs, so sad and slow
And I'm so sick of wishin' I had you on my own
And oh, baby, I've been fucked up ever since you've been gone
I can't bring myself to even pick up my phone
I need you the most, I need you the most

OVER YOU Lyrics[Verse 1]
You left me bleeding out when I was down, I had to heal myself
Got a lot of friends, but I feel alone, only one I hear is myself
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, not a single soul I can tell
I look around, I got everything, but I'm still livin' in hell
Uh, talkin' to the voices in my head, let 'em tell it, I'd be better dead
Pour a cup of my problems out and I smoke a zip of my regrets
M.O.B., money over sex 'til I D-I-E, boy, I need my checks
Walkin' out on me cut deep, I've been scarred since the day you left

[Chorus]
I'm over waiting on you
I told you, I'm over waiting on you
You can have it your way
Yeah, you don't have a place in my heart no more
It's time to go separate ways
'Cause I'm over waiting on you, yeah
[Verse 2]
Cuts too deep for a Band-Aid, with my new bitch thinkin' old things
'Cause after how you left me, I won't ever trust these bitches again
Paranoia on my mind, I can't help it, I won't change
Ben Frank' the only one I know in this whole world that won't fail
Runnin' and runnin' in circles with you, you keep on doing the same shit again
I swear that you left me no other choice, I cannot look at these bitches the same
I cannot look at all bitches the same, when I take your heart, know I'm taking your name
And the way that you ran my heart into the grave, I guess I have to charge it to the game

[Chorus]
I'm over waiting on you
I told you, I'm over waiting on you
You can have it your way
Yeah, you don't have a place in my heart no more
It's time to go separate ways
'Cause I'm over waiting on you8Embed

PIKACHU Lyrics[Chorus]
I pull up, in a yellow Lambo' like Pikachu (Oh, yeah)
My teachers said I wouldn't be shit, now look at you (Oh)
I know you're somewhere, down bad
'Cause I just spent your whole check on a pair of some Jimmy Choo's (Oh, yeah)
I got nothing to prove, but a whole lot to lose
My mama used to sell drugs to pay for my school
My uncle Dub got knocked and ended up on the news
This all I know, I had to do this, I couldn't pick and choose

[Verse]
I used to pray for some better days
Ten years later, I'm in L.A. whippin' that Bentayga
I'm paid up with entertainers, Henny, no chaser
And bad bitches by the cases, they entertain us
I know my ex-bitch down bad and regretting
Leavin' me and watchin' every little thing I do
I know my old friends tell they new friends
That I switched up and tell 'em stories that were never true
Shit ain't nothin' new (Nah), I'm livin' comfortable
How the fuck you hating? Just two years ago, I was like you
Ninth grade, dropped out of school, used to sleep on JD's couch
This year I bought my mom a house, who would've knew that I would?
[Chorus]
Pull up, in a yellow Lambo' like Pikachu (Oh, yeah)
My teachers said I wouldn't be shit, now look at you (Oh)
I know you're somewhere, down bad
'Cause I just spent your whole check on a pair of some Jimmy Choo's (Oh, yeah)
I got nothing to prove, but a whole lot to lose
My mama used to sell drugs to pay for my school
My uncle Dub got knocked and ended up on the news
This all I know, I had to do this, I couldn't pick and choose

[Outro]
Yeah, I get to thinking of this shit, it's like, hm, look
Never did you wrong, never told you nothing wrong, no
I always kept it one hundred from the jump, oh
I always tried to keep it cool, but you were so cold (I did)
There's a lot more to the story that they don't know (Oh, woah)
There's a lot more to the story than the photo (Oh, oh)
There's a lot more to the story and we both know
But it's okay, I'll be good, no, oh
Long as my money right, I'll be good, no, oh
Long as my bitch fine, I'll be good, oh-oh
Long as the circle tight, then I'm good, on God13Embed

ERASE U Lyrics[Chorus]
I thought you was all mine, yeah
You said that you love me, but it's all lies, yeah
Shoulda known from when I looked in your eye
If I could erase you from my mind
Then I'd be alright, yeah, I'd be alright
You said you was all mine, yeah

Shit ain't been the same since you left now
Only thing going through my head is regret now
Waiting for you, I almost let my bread down
You got me stressed out
Left me to get let down
But somehow I'm still wishin' you all the best now
I think it's better now
'Cause you really put my ego up in check now
And I'm upset now
Ever since you let me down
And I'm upset now

'Cause I thought you was all mine, yeah
You said that you love me, but it's all lies, yeah
Shoulda known from when I looked in your eye
If I could erase you from my mind

You said you was all mine, yeah
You said that you love me, but it's all lies, yeah
