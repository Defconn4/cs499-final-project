Story Time Lyrics[Intro]
Huh

[Verse]
Let me tell a little sad story about this young boy, grew up, no pops in the crib
That nigga momma workin' so she couldn't really show him no love when he was a kid (AyoAA)
He didn't even mean to do that incident
He was only eighteen when he  caught that bid
He in and out of jail, he ain't know how to move
He ain't know how to fight, he ain't know how to lose
He walked in the spot (Spot)
They told him, "Strip, cough, squat" (Uh)
The C.O. just told him that this is procedure but he knew in his mind that he was doin' a lot
He had to figure it out and then learn all the rules and then follow them, like it or not
He caught a new charge 'cause he had a little weed
Tryna sneak this shit in, it was right in his sock
Yeah, they had him in intake for like a week
They hate his guts, they think he killed police
They made it super cold with the AC
They ain't give him no blanket, they ain't give him no sheets
They put him in a cell with a dirty ass sink
He couldn't think, he couldn't sleep
They gave him no soap to wash his ass
They ain't give him no toothpaste to brush his teeth (Look)
He ain't know why they keep botherin' him, he was kinda scared, ain't wanna argue with him
Pacin' back and forth, they keep on followin' him
Couldn't take it no more, and he finally hit him (Yeah, look)
The C.O. done hit the button and they come and they helpin' him and run in and crack his ass
He just took a beatin' and unleashed the demon
He lookin' to grillin' and actin' bad
He ain't never been locked up before but he made up his mind
He like, "Fuck it, if this how it start"
They couldn't count him out 'cause anybody who know lil' homie, know lil' homie got heart
He gon' adapt to his habitat, even if his habitat get dark (Uh)
He was a lil' fish when he jumped in the water
And then he grew into a shark (Then he grew into a shark)
Two years later (Uh), nine fights in, he found his religion
He started workin' out, takin' food, soups and respect 'cause this shit wasn't given
He wanted more for his life, he was sittin' in jail every night and his life wasn't hittin' (Life wasn't hittin')
And his life wasn't hittin' (His life wasn't hittin')
And his life wasn't, look (Nah)
Two years, he fought the case and he ain't worry 'bout it
In his mind he knew he ain't losin'
He got a paid lawyer, that's a good lawyer
And that lawyer do know what he doin'
They wanna take it to trial, so he take it to trial
But that little nigga goin' through it (Huh)
He was just holdin' it down for his mans 'cause he wasn't the one that was doin' the shootin' (Bow)
He didn't cop out to this damn lie, call home and found out his man died
He looked up to the sky like, "Damn, why?"
'Cause he's locked in the cell and he can't slide
All hell break lose when that man cry, you can see the demon in his damn eyes
That nigga a vampire, hah (Bow)
If he want you dead, then it's verified (Bow)
And he went back in his cell and he thought to himself like, "Damn, I feel a lil' stupid"
He got a big gun in the crib but he's stuck in the jam and he can't even use it
He want a re-trial and take back everything that he said 'cause he know he ain't do it
Lil' homie a real nigga, he done made a decision already and he stickin' to it
Uh, yeah, he stickin' to it, uh
[Outro]
Yeah, huh
Yeah, uh
Fivi, back, look8Embed

13 Going on 30 Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, let's do it
(Bordeaux and Non Native)
Yeah, (Uh) uh, yeah
Niggas gave up on me (Niggas gave up on me)
Watched them give up on me
Huh, ayy, look, uh

[Chorus]
Them niggas gave up on me
Should've  never gave up on me
A nigga made it, homie
And rewarded everybody who waited on me
I watched 'em switch (Uh, switch)
They not 'bout to switch back (Uh)
Life is a bitch (Yeah)
I get you bitch smacked (Bow)
Look, give me a break, Kit Kat (uh)
I know she want me to hit that
But I'm focusеd on a big bag
I'll let you fuck when I get back
[Verse]
Now I'm makin' biggеr moves
I've been lied on, I've been ridiculed (Uh)
Them niggas pitiful
They'll switch up on you for an interview (Uh)
Yeah, they'll switch up on you for an interview (Uh)
All in the front (Uh), everywhere I go, I go with a gun
Every case I caught, I go on the run (bow)
Every folk I see gone go in the trunk
Every nigga take em' home in a blunt
Every night I'm gon' go home when I want
I remember I was down in the dumps
I was feedin' niggas, givin' them lunch
Niggas forget (Niggas forget)
But I remember (But I remember)
My bitch is pregnant, my mom's in the hospital dying
Damn it was early December
I’m losin' my crib (Oof), my life in a blender (Uh)
I really said what I did and I did what I said
I was never one of these pretenders

[Chorus]
Some niggas gave up on me
Should've never gave up on me
A nigga made it, homie
And rewarded everybody who waited on me
I watched 'em switch (Uh, switch)
They not 'bout to switch back (Uh)
Life is a bitch (Yeah)
I get you bitch smacked (Bow)
Look, give me a break, Kit Kat (uh)
I know she want me to hit that
But, I'm focused on a big bag
I'll let you fuck when I get back
[Bridge]
I gave them my life (I gave them my life)
I gave 'em all of me
I see you ballin', but how you gon' win against the winners?
Boy, you're playin' in the wrong team
Yeah, I let the doggies off the dog leash (Uh)
Yeah, I let the doggies off the dog leash (Uh)

[Outro]
Yeah
Don't let them niggas tell you, you can't do this shit, nigga
The key to this shit, nigga
Is to be the better version of the last you
Whether it was a pic, a trip, your video, your bitch, upgrade
Everybody think you're supposed to look at what's lit and then follow that
Don't follow that, nigga
Do it for the people who love you
The people that don't love you, they just don't love you yet
Uh
R.I.P. Pop Smoke
We gon' take this shit to the top
The smoke will never clear, nigga

Yeah, she couldn't stop (She couldn't stop)
I pray to God that I see an opp
He think he shot at my niggas
One time and we take everything but his sneakers and socks
Mention my name when you speak on the block
Picture my face when you reach for the Glock
I could just do it and act like it's nothin'
They asking like "Fivi', it's easy or not?" (Huh)
I got a story and I'll nеver tell it
I got a soul and I'll nevеr sell it
I see them hatin', they watchin', they jealous
Like how you get a million dollars on the debit?
How you get a million views on the edit?
We marry a million bitches without a wedding
He got a millions bitches in the section
That's like a million bitches to have sex with
I got some demons that's hotter than me
They keep on wakin' me out of my sleep
I look on the 'Gram, they ain't hotter than me
'Cause I'm killin' the fits, and I body the feats, huh, woo (killin'the fits and body the feats, ha, Fivi')
Yeah, look, all of my shooters alert
If I tell 'em I pay 'em the money, they doing the work
Bullets is bitin' and chewing his shirt
Show up to the funeral and we shoot at his hearse
I chill with the bitches and roll with my niggas
And hang with the baddest and move with the worst
Shorty a baddie, she wish she could have me
I ask for her name and I Google her worth (Ha)

We put the laser on top of the Glock when we slid on the weekend with blinding lights (Yeah)
I'm tryna bury a nigga, get off the block 'cause you ain't from this area, nigga (Yeah)
Get shot in stomach, that's a miscarriage, nigga
Fuck is you starin' at a nigga?
For the record I might have to address all the niggas that say I'm an industry plant
They say all my cars is rented, I guess they ain't used to us young niggas havin' these racks
These niggas be troll, we fuckin' they hoes
They get on the internet, go on a rant
He try to approach, he gon' get turned to a ghost
'Cause I got this bitch in my pants
I probably punch a nigga if he glance
I'm finna shoot, don't worry 'bout my stance
I got my broad a new Hellcat
When you hop in this Rolls, put your hair back
I was in the hood when they tote Glocks and they sell crack in the same motherfucking houses
When we in the club, I go through the backdoor
I don't trust nobody, I'ma pick your ass off (Let's go)
Right now I'm in Vegas tryna get a bad bitch to come through
Maybe she can take the edge off
Ain't got nobody, when she go to the bathroom
I'ma take off and start to head home

You niggas could die in a matter of seconds (Baow)
He gon' answer me, no matter the question
I talked to God and I had a confession
More money, more problems, I'm mad at the blessings
And I pulled my body on a provin' ground
Since a youngin', I now know how to move around
Get the addy, we pull up and shoot him down
Better watch how you move in that hookah lounge
Boy, you show me in person, come do it now
You need to keep your lil' word and then do a vow
Nigga why you think I feel like you a clown?
I would never agree with what you allow, what you allow (What you allow)
A bigger GAT (Big GAT)
If he want space, I'ma give him that

And I know they gon' call when it hit the fan
I was young but I grew to a different man
Niggas hatin' like "How did he get advanced?" (Ah)
He was workin' (Huh, he was workin'), he was workin' (Huh)
Huh, they tried to fuck him, but he's not a virgin
He was a kid, then he grew to a person
He had to get rid of the snakes and the serpents
He had to fuck all the bitches that curved him
He cut 'em off, 'cause they didn't deserve him (Ha)
They didn't deserve him (Nah)

Took too many losses, can't hold back
Fuck all the cap, these cold facts
'Member back then nobody showed up
Hit the stage and now all of my shows packed
It's too easy to drill shit (Drill shit)
They should know I'm from, Chicago
I was walkin' through blocks tryna kill shit
I was really at the stu' with Pop Smoke
They can go 'head keep on gassin' him up 'til his ass get filled with hollows
All this fame be too much to deal with
They clout chase, but the truth what I know, uh
I'm with my steppers and we like a band in the field 'cause we drummin' and ready to march
I know some niggas that changed, ain't know what to feel, left me with the heaviest heart
I had to grind all of them nights, just 'cause of my skill made it look like it's barely as hard
Look up and I took off on all these niggas, I know that they wishin' I left it in park, gang
[Chorus: Vory]
Hey, feel like some niggas done changed on me
Hey, I never thought he would change on me
Hey, I was livin' what this money would bring on me

Squeeze (Freestyle) Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah (Ayo AA)

[Verse 1]
I was told if you fight, you swing first
I was told if you shoot, you squeeze first
Nigga, why would I give you a free verse
When it's fifteen-hundred for my t-shirt?
They remember me broke on the streets, hurt
That mean you better give me what I deserve
If I catch him, I'm makin' him bleed first
If I'm missin', I'm hittin' in reverse
And they always gon' tell me I'm movin' funny
If you wasn't my man, it'd be worse
Like, imagine I'd make you say, "Please" first
Like, imagine I'd laugh and say, "He's hurt"
Like, imagine I'm livin' and rappin' and talkin' and chattin'
And see him and fall back
When I met him in person, he's all cap
When he met me, I'm ready for combat
When I met her, she look like a baddie and move like a baddie
She thought she was all that
When I fuck, she ain't gettin' a call back
They be fallin' in love with my tall ass
If you owe me, you pay me in all cash
When I see him, it's gettin' me more mad
If we kill him, so don't get the bork ass
When I run in your crib, it's a door dash, huh
[Chorus]
Huh, yeah, huh, look, huh, I been a mess
I hear them hatin' and talkin' and whisperin' and watchin'
And mumblin' under they breath
Huh, huh, yeah, look, hmm, yeah, they be obsessed
They keep on wonderin' how I keep winnin'
But they already know that I'm one of the best

[Verse 2]
He already know he gettin' one in his chest
He already know that it's none of me left
Them niggas say I can't do it, they count on me losin'
But they never come with a bet
Them niggas say they get money
They say they be workin', but they never thumb through a check
Boy when you come to me, come with respect
I'm not acceptin' nothin' less
Yeah, nigga, go put your money where your mouth is
Nigga, I put my money where my clout is
I put my gun where my spouse live
And I'm goin' dummy every outfit
You either love me or leave me alone
Casamigo help me get in the zone
Niggas still trappin' and flippin' the phones
Niggas still clappin' and grippin' the chrome, huh
[Chorus]
Huh, yeah, huh, look, huh, I been a mess
I hear them hatin' and talkin' and whisperin' and watchin'
And mumblin' under they breath
Huh, huh, yeah, look, hmm, yeah, they be obsessed
They keep on wonderin' how I keep winnin'
But they already know that I'm one of the best1Embed
