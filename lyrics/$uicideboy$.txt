Kill Yourself (Part III) Lyrics[Chorus: Butterfly Boucher]
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

[Verse 1: Ruby da Cherry]
They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
Snow Leopard with the lead in his head, turnin' me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent
I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest
Big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave
I'm matter, but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
Brain splattered on the wall
Grey stains won't dissolve, gonna have to paint it all
[Chorus: Butterfly Boucher]
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

[Verse 2: $lick $loth]
Always boasting my emotions on how I'm so fucking broken
Think I'm joking when I'm talkin' about blowing my head open
'Til the moment you walk in and find my body motionless
Wrists slit, thoughts of $licky falling in an open pit, shit
Always burn my bridges 'cause I'd rather fall in ditches
If life's a game of inches, then my dick has been the biggest
And my goal's to fuck the world until that motherfucker's twitchin'
Lane switchin', same mission, to die and blame my addiction, bitch

[Chorus: Butterfly Boucher]
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might336Embed

Paris Lyrics[Intro: $lick $loth]
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: $lick $loth]
Tell me what you know 'bout a motherfucker out the bottom
With a gold grill gleamin', makin' all these hoes problems
Stalker, creepin' out the fuckin' dungeon
Switchblade on 'em, hit the guts like a pumpkin, dumpin'
Thirty rounds of the clip, off rip
Too thick with the stick, bet I won't miss
Lil $lick real sick, don't talk shit
Whip, whip, like a brick scale on fish
$uicide, night time, no, we don't fight crime, oh
It's the Grey*59 with the real red eyes, and we dying inside, ooh
Bodies in fluoride, let the rope untie, just crucify me
Yung Christ wrists sliced, couple hoes on ice, singing, "R.I.P."
[Verse 2: Ruby da Cherry]
Ruby was a motherfucking reject
Then I cut my wrists, and now I motherfucking bleed checks
Still broke after all the motherfucking weed gets rolled
Hoes askin' if I see a ghost
Tell 'em, "No, I just seep smoke when the weed's blown"
She chokes from the deep-throat, three feet of rope, lethal
Slay the fuckin' sheep, so evil, I'ma hang myself
And then I get to see home, Ruby a fucking demon (Ayy, uh)
Ruby got a cult now, hoes tryna bolt down
Ruby the result of a reject from a small town
Turned into a demon, I'm evolved now
Loud growl, $now Leopard on the prowl, ayy
Stay the fuck back, ho, slay the whole pack, ho
Paint the globe black, ho (Ayy)
Soon I will shed this skin, turn to the devil
Then I'll never reminisce (Ayy)

$outh $ide $uicide Lyrics[Verse 1: $lick $loth]
Outside in an all black ride, tint rolled up when I'm high
Said they all wanna live, but I just wanna die
Mo-Motherfucker, if you're looking for me, find me in the night
I got a knife, don't wanna fight
I wanna take your fucking life, and end it right on sight
When I strike, if you bark, better bite
Block hot, fuck the cops, pop a six-shot Glock
Then I trot to the rocks, with me own blood clot
Red-dot, bodies drop when I cock, then I spot
No tomb, no plot, throw 'em off of the yacht, undocked
With the slot of the skull hangin' in the fucking river, ho
$ui-$uicide, 6-6-6, *59, so cynical

[Verse 2: Yung Plague]
Got a pound in the blunt, I'm loungin'
Pour another round, I'm drownin'
Climb to the top, I will jump off the mountain, ayy
Swerv-swervin' in a motherfucking all-white Crown Vic'
Blue light mounted, siren howlin'
Stole it from a cop because he popped another brown kid (Ayy)
Got the town lit up by the flame that I made
From my grey serenade, make way for the Plague
On the seventh day, grey bodies lay in they graves
Still got the badge, still got the gun
Still got the patch, still got the stun
Still got the cash, bitch, I burn it for fun
Put the Glock to my skull then I—
[Verse 3: Pouya]
Yuh, yuh, yuh
$outh $ide $uicide, kill yourself, ho
Say you gettin' money, but your numbers don't show, you a liar
Baseball bat fully wrapped in barbed wire
For anyone that's tryna get by us (Bitch)
I been thinkin' a lot, I see these rappers tryna get at my spot
Robb told me, "You gotta get it how you live"
Told that bitch, "You better get up out my biz"
Pickle-breath-ass ho with a face like thizz (Shut the fuck up)
You don't want no issue with
Nose seen more blow than most nose seen a tissue
I got anxiety so I can't really do a interview
Don't come close to me
I'm not the one to really do it how it's 'posed to be
Independent, tell that label to get over me
I'm over here with my peers, gettin' rich point blank
Before I bring her to the crib, make sure that bitch don't stink
Ain't no rules to the game, talk how you want (Yuh)
Walk how you want (Yuh), my job is the shit
I used to clean up shit from the rim of the toilet
Now I'm gettin' money, I don't gotta pack a pistola
Okay, maybe (Maybe)
'Cause jealousy make a man go crazy
Money make a motherfucker hate me
One thousand bitches, they all wanna date me134Embed

Antarctica Lyrics[Intro: Haley Gibby]
Letting a new day begin
Letting a new day begin
Letting a new day begin
Hold to the time that you know

[Verse 1: YUNG $CARECROW]
Locked in my room, four black walls
Tie the noose, no recall
No resolve, fuck withdrawal
Rather shoot up till I fall
Murder on call with the *59
Twenty years, and it seem like a lifetime
I been hanging every day from a lifeline
While these fuckers had a dinner every night time
Smo-, smokin' that dope off the foil, let me ball
Ho, please don't call, don't fuck with y'all
Spray paint the walls with blood and whatever
Drag you outside, let you rot in the weather
I don't think I can explain any better
I'm $carecrow the terror and  live for the lesser
My birth was an error
[Verse 2: LORD OF LONELINESS]
I am the Lord of Loneliness
I'll hold my breath, just spoke with Death
He said he hopes for the best
Told him I'm ropin' my neck
Then I woke up chokin' from the hole in my chest
Somehow I manage to function and hope
Every day got a lump in my throat
That's them pills swallowed whole
Smoke a blunt and then fuck all these hoes
End up humpin' they throat
Get the fuck away from me, I hate all of you, faithfully
This world was never made for me
Thankfully, I'm trained to see past all the lies, the ranks, the scenes
I'll shank my knees, then walk the plank and freeze

2nd Hand Lyrics[Intro: SOULJA RAG MURDER]
Grey*59, all I see is scrubs
Face mean mugged
On a couple drugs
Smoke with Migo Plug
FTP, my blood
Grey the fucking gang
Boy, stay in your lane

Never high, just maintain
Hate this fame, hate this game
Take these shoes, last a day
Oil flowing through my veins
Lil Remains, that make that stang

Insane, real blade, swing it through your fucking brain
I said fuck 'em (fuck 'em!)
We got a problem (what?)
Fuck you gonna do with it? (huh?)
I think nada (nah)
Just a persona (fugazi), and I'm Nirvana (Cobain)
Poppin' xans to make you mad, I know you want some
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Got an ounce of the coke, white snow flurry (what?)
River Road shawty, Yung Christ, one chosen
$lick tote the AK-47, stolen, woadie joscing

All of y'all are over-saturating 'Preme and Bape
Bitch, it's FTP all fucking day, all y'all look the fucking same
Fuck the fame, fuck a lane
Bitch, I'm 'bout to swerve into the toll booth, and scrape the change
Bring out your dead and blamin' it on Yung Plague
Bitch, I pull up with the K
K9 by my right leg 'till I say okay
Canine on his hind legs, rippin' off your face
All I gotta say is G*59 until the grave
One color, two numbers
Three fingers in the sky, amongst the thunder
I'm like, "Fuck the others"
I'ma, bring the ruckus
I might, fuck your bitch
She swears, she suffers under the covers
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma hellhound, hell-bound, shawty wanna die
I'ma sell pounds, sell pounds
Shawty said she might, let them bells pound, bells pound
Shawty wanna cry, I'm like, "Fuck it" every night
Keep turning black, I close my eyes85Embed

Slumped back in the driver's seat
Blunt between my lips, I'm ridin' with a bitch that's high as me
She duckin' out, she tryna sleep
I'm duckin' out, I'm tryna see the road
But all I can see are four horsemen comin' closer to me
I think I'm about to die, we'll see
Swervin' on them motherfuckers, bitch, it ain't my time
Let the world blow up first, then I might just close my eyes
It's all I really wanted my whole life
The universe won't notice, bitch, you just another life
The sun'll rise, the stars have already died

[Verse 2: YUNG $CARECROW]
(I!) see the reaper creepin' as my blood is seeping
Sleeping deeper through the night, so I can face my demons
(My!) weakness seems to be that I cannot stop breathing
Death keeps cheating on my life, but on my soul, it's feeding
(It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on)
Leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
Screaming and needing, yelling and pleading
That things ain't as they seem
In the cut, sneaking and tweakin'
Because I can't stop seeking this pain, this torture of horror
That I'm always conceding

[Verse 1: $WITCHBLADE $CRIM]
Eternal rest, the bloody mess
Keepin' the motherfucking devil hot
Satanic mentality, happily makin' the bodies drop
I'm on the block, circling cops
Ready for their demise
Screams resonate through the night, so I can't close my eyes
Hard to swallow when the hollows enter through your throat
Lately, I wallow in my sorrow 'cause I cannot cope
The dope, the coke, the drank, the lean
The pills, the X, the smoke
The rope to choke the pain away, I'm broken til' I croak
Ho

Dead, a nigga dead, dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
A nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head, dead, a nigga dead

Baby (Baby)
Baby, let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Baby, let me get the weed, there's more for us
When these suckers leave, yeah, we can smoke a blunt and fuck
I bust a nut, and now it's time to get the fuck up out my crib
Yeah, here's a couple bucks
Bitch, I'm Oddy Nuff, creepin' out the cut
Blood seepin' out my cut
With the shotty, 'cause you might escape the Tommy gun
Because I'm busy puffin' blunts
But soon enough you'll come back 'round
You screamin', "Lock me up—please, box me up!"
I got you, sucker
Start a flame, and turn your body into dust
Smoke your body in the blunt, copy us, I'll light it up

Walk in with a dead bitch, and a Swisher lit, drug kit
Got a half-hit worth of acid, can't quit, I'm an addict
So traumatic, and I'm manic
Feeling panicked, I need a Xanax
Pass it, as I OD real slowly
Lonely, looking ghostly
Surrounded by smoky mirror images of a fictionist, sober me
Don't give a fuck about harming me
I'm druggin' 'till I R.I.P

[Chorus: Gangsta Boo]
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high

[Verse 2: NORMAN ATOMIC]
Take a hit of acid, been a while since I tripped
Now I'm seein' all this shit, brain glowing
Everything is bending in the same motion
Roll the blunt, I'll take a hit
Start staring at the smoke, as it twists and disappears
Peer pressure don't affect me, bitch, I take drugs on my own
Pop a perc' and snort some coke
It feel like my heart is broke because I get fucked up when I feel alone
I'm choking on this forty of OE, I'm hopin' that I don't breathe
Bitch, I'm dope, act like you know me
Shoot me up so I can OD

But I don't know
Yung $now kind of go with the flow
Bring a ho backstage, tell her, "tell me everything you know about life"—then I bounce
Roxy hitting hard, feeling fucking sick

Have to smoke a half an ounce just to balance it out
Ruby backing out
Ruby blacking out
Falling fucking deeper, I think Ruby cashing out
Grass is always greener when the grave is lacking crowds
Look who's laughing now
(Hit the blunt)
An audience crackin' up, you can let the curtains down now, yuh

I wallow in sorrow, ain't no tomorrow
Missed a call from $lick, I woke up in a gown, how?

Rolling down your block, it ain't shit for the set to- (Crush it up)
Told that bitch, "Get out my ear"
She need to chill and- (Hit the blunt)
Xanax bars up in my drink, before I pour 'em (Crush it up)
We never fuck with you, fuckboy
Don't act like you can- (Hit the blunt)
Take that motherfucking bat upside your skull and- (Crush it Up)
So full of them drugs, I might throw up
I knew I shouldn't have- (Hit the blunt)

Carrollton Lyrics[Intro: Juicy J]
Play me some of that $uicide pimpin', man

[Verse 1: LIL CUT THROAT]
You motherfuckers pitiful, I'm too sick of you
I'm a walking visual, you boys refillable
Unforgivable, once you cross me, ho
Now you a motherfucking stain to Lil Cut Throat (pop!)
Let the guns bang
Nuts hang, drug game ain't the same
"$avage" tatted on my face
Grey ape
Blazing while we hotbox
Fuck a badge, fuck a cop, even if the K hot
Watch me bust on any block
Northside knotty
Scope on the shotty, semi blow ya body
Tony gripping on the Tommy, bitch
I bite the head off a bat like I'm Ozzy
You got a problem motherfucker? Come and try me
I'm nothing like what you punk boys wanna embody
Norf, Norf, East Side *59
Tony gripping Tommy
Fuck around end up get your body, autopsy
I be that walking zombie, bath salts
Eating bodies
Three choppa's and a shotty shooting everybody
Cigarette wet wet, bumpin' Boosie Badazz
On them drugs, jiggin’
Jaws locked—clinching
Trigger finger itching if you think I’m kidding
Smoke leaking from the sticky that we smoking, boy
Fuck a Backwood, Swisher's what I use, boy
Smoke what I choose, do what I wanna do
Motherfuck you and (Ruby—) your punk friends too
[Verse 2: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Ruby blunt lit, lungs itch, bitch, I like the sting
Smoking potent thinking I'm the chosen one, bitch, I'm a king
I can hear my dead homies sing
Now my eyes always hurtin', wiping tears with diamond rings, yeah, ayy
Hol' up fuckboy, who the fuck said we cool?
Man, I quit smoking with hypebeasts back in 2002
What it do? Motherfucker, I'm a fool
Ruby da Cherry is cooling with goblins
If you got a problem, then you better move
From the womb to the tomb
Busting out early, busting out soon
Blackout the city, I'm back on them 30s
In 'bout twenty minutes we'll be on the moon, uh
Drugs got me fucked up, sluts got me drugged up, fuck
Slam my face against a pill to crush it up
Government ID helps me get high
Seeing stars in the mirror like I'm looking with a bright beam
Lime green paint but the rims looking Spike Lee
Mighty be sloppy, might be cocky, am I in the right scene?
Highly unlikely, and I'm willing to fucking bet
Leave a pussy wet then I leave a pussy wet
I'm a fucking vet, I'm a motherfucking threat
G*59 the set, G*59 will make you sweat
"I don’t give a fuck" is my fucking epithet
Lace up my Nike Decades, meet me at Heaven's Gate
7th Ward by the lake 'til my death

Questioning my decisions (Decisions)
Burning down all the bridges (Bridges)

Reply, turn into a needle, yeah
Don't wanna do it again
Got shit I'm not tryna relive
Head fucked up and I'm sick
These old habits will kill me quick
Quicker than I can blink
Quicker than I could think
Lift me up, don't want to sink
Pour me up, I need a drink
What the fuck do I do
When sabotage is all I know? Oh
I done dug myself
My own grave in this hole, oh, more, woah
Kill me slow, slow
Curtains closed low
Fuck, I don't see what's the point of going on, no89Embed

Call list overflowed with hotlines
Drug help, mental, $uicide
Feel tired, feel dried, and you wanna die
Pride fried, closed eyes, and you start to cry
Swear I spent a lifetime tryna get it right
Still isolated, still outta sight
Keep my dreads swingin' like they in a fight
I just wanna kill everyone in sight
Take the money, take the bitches, take the drugs, take the gold
Baby, let me decompose
Never names said, more shade spit
I'ma see you one day, that's a promise

Bitch, come through, blue veins turn into new stains
One of the original seven like Liu Kang
Slit the wrist of the six, no one left but me, bitch
The 7th Ward Lord got a new name
But Ruby does not exist due to a personality split
One-half devil, other half got zipped
Now, who the fuck else wanna talk shit?
Now, who the fuck else wanna get ripped?
Now, who the fuck else think I'm a bitch?
Come take a fucking sit
I swear to no god, you'll end up in a crypt
[Verse 2: YUNG CHRIST]
Snappin' like necks from that Bank on the west
Kurt Cobain veins, opium in my chest
Escaped out the psych ward, now I'm on a murder spree
Voices inside of me, won't let me go to sleep
Drownin' in sleeping pills, covered in ashes
Ridin' down Paris, this life never mattered
Ready to die, bitch, I'm ready to die
I pull on this trigger got blood on my satin
"Fuck, is he okay?" No, I'm just insane
Deranged out the gate, it's always been my fate
Lil $licky ride the pain, Ruby pumpin' shotty
Crucified in Tommy, Yung Christ risen out the concrete

Memoirs of a Gorilla Lyrics[Intro]
I am known

[Verse 1: Yung $carecrow]
Triple six serpents of death crawlin' under your skin
If I take a bet, you can guess who gon' win
I walk in the 'jects without no protection
I function in hoods every city I'm in
I'm that Grey-born gorilla out the concrete jungle
Duckin' from the dope 'cause I just shot a bundle
$carecrow make the chopper drum shots rumble
$carecrow got the dope game from my uncle
Huh, still prefer the drugs over bitches
Better watch your side that you pickin'
Snakes start hissin', heads go missing
Rest in piss to the ones I'm killing
Chief Keef drilling, codeine spilling
Blood on my linen from the cuts, never healing
Hot boys out the crypt with a mouth full of scripts
Body bags zip when the gun hammer click
[Verse 2: 7th Ward Dragon]
Ruby leveled up
Ruby leveled up
Ruby gon' global, epidemic proportion
I got the torch, and now I'm lighting up gas on the porch
Kick back, now I'm bored
$lick asked for the short, flick ash for the sport, uh
Ruby wrestles several devils in the 7th Ward
But Ruby can't afford to move towards the horde just yet
7th Ward Dragon with a fiery sword through the neck
Engulfed in flames, engulfed in blood
As it rains from the red heaven that Yung Plague has escaped
Levitate over Lake Pontchartrain
Set 'em straight, no, we are not the same
Yeah, it's hard to remain when you're self-slain
Yeah, it's all that remains when you're self-made
Ruby 'bout to take a second breath, uh
Embrace yourself, because all that remains is the bloodstains88Embed

For the Last Time Lyrics[Verse 1: Lil Choppa]
Stay in the cut on the Northside
Hollow-points, trigger fingers on my fucking .45
Demons risin' out the crypt, I snort me a fat line
Never gave a fuck, grew up out the mud
Pull up, then I pop the trunk
Grew up with the fucking robbers, always kept the mask on
Motherfuckers gon' die if we keep the mask off
$uicide when I ride, bitch, $carecrow the walking shadow
Mozart with no piano, kill when I'm Sleepy Hollow
That mystic motherfucker that's addicted to prescriptions
Xanax for the panic, mental problems you can add in
Multi-million owned business—you just signed a deal, bruh?
Three years passed, still broke and you ain't paid up
Dollars I ain't touched yet, burn it for the fuck of it
Infamous lunatic, you? You just suck dick
Cut Throat with the deathwish, raised where the savage lives
Straight out the death pit, to keep alive the triple six
[Verse 2: YUNG MUTT]
Ruby such a Misfit (Uh)
Hollywood Babylon, can't resist it (Nah)
Fuck a cop, bitch, I'm duckin' all these piglets (Bop)
7th Ward be my motherfucking district (7th Ward)
Yeah, I still got my motherfuckin' wrist slit
Bleeding like a pissed bitch, schemin', I'ma hit licks
After lickin' hits of acid in her fucking split lips
Wig split, just a fuckin' tidbit, dick itch from ingestin' pill bits
Blue bill sick of snortin' powder
I'ma ditch this hunnid for five twenties
TSA keep testin' my money, now I'ma dip quick (Later)
Find me a thick bitch (Wait)
Tit gripped, tip gripped, dick spit in her thick hips, fuck
Fuck with me, bitch, I'm a-fucking-'dicted
And I don't really give a fuck what it is
Told you already that Ruby can't resist it
Big clip to my head, watch that shit drip65Embed

FUCKTHEPOPULATION Lyrics[Intro: RUBY DA CHERRY]
(All of this pussy the devil
Six, six, six
All of this pussy the devil, all of this cash the devil
All of this cash the devil, the devil, the devil
All of this lean is the devil, all of this pussy the devil)

[Chorus: RUBY DA CHERRY]
All of this pussy the devil
All of this cash is the devil
All of this ash is the devil
All of these pills is the devil
All of this lean is the devil
I won't go to heaven, nah
I won't go to heaven, nah
I won't go to heaven, nah
I won't go to heaven, nah
I won't go to heaven, nah
[Verse 1: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Bitch, I be that broke boy
Two scripts half-full make a full script, mean I'm running out
Bitch, I be a ho toy, making two bad bitches bashful
Coming out they nutshell, pass me the rag, fool
Bitch, I be that dope boy
Smoke cash, ash snowing on the broke glass
Throat slashed, now I got a blood-soaked rash
Go bash in a fuck boy's skull, wearin' no mask, toe tag
Make the rope last, don't ask
Uh, al-all of my vices the devil
Fuck all this nice shit, I meddle in murderous temptation
Roll up the windows, and push down the pedal
Burn a cigarette in my wrist, that 7th Ward shit
Fuck a bitch, then dip
No tint, gas tank on E
'64 Impala at the bottom of a cliff, bitch

[Chorus: $UICIDE CHRIST]
All this heroin is the devil
All these Xanax is the devil
All of these murders the devil
All of these hoes is the devil
Bitch, I am the devil, the devil
And I can't go to heaven, nah
I can't go to heaven, nah
I can't go to heaven, nah
I can't go to heaven, nah
I can't go to heaven, nah
[Verse 2: $UICIDE CHRIST]
K-Keeping it packin' with a hunnid rounds
Keep them dead bodies all on the ground
Posted in Memphis, at Orange Mound
TA rollin' the loud when we come around
Smokin' and drinkin', I ain't never thinking
Popping them pills 'til I'm under the cement
Six-hundred sixty-six, smokin' that reefer
If you looking for dope, ho, I got it for cheaper
New Orleans crypt keeper, the killer, the creeper
Believe me that demons are real once you see us
Fuck boys wanna be us, the hoes wanna please us
Ask in yo' city, they'll tell you I'm Jesus
The motherfucking Antichrist
$uicide, we anti-life

[Outro: $UICIDE CHRIST]
Bitch, don't make me tell you twice
That I can't go to heaven, nah59Embed

LTE Lyrics[Intro: Yung Christ]
I be that-
I be that- ($ui- $ui-)
I be that-

[Verse 1: Yung Christ]
I be that skinny fiend sippin' lean, caffeine with codeine
I'm smoking nicotine, PCP, pills in my cuisine
I'm fucking draped in suede, wrist dismayed
$uicide renegade
Pop a couple waves up in my grave, carvin' my skin with the blade
I-I don't fuck with squealers, known drug dealer
Stealer with the sealer
$lickity always wrecked, bitch, get checked
Grey*59 the set, chopper make 'em wet
Watch me flex, y'all just second best
Never second guess
Manifest, triple six 'til death
[Verse 2: Ruby da Cherry]
Ruby ain't my motherfucking true name
If I wrote it down, it would combust into a blue flame
Gloom gang banging, whole crew slain
Bodies in the suitcase, polo body bag full of bootlegs
Two-two-faced bitch, sick a duck
Got your bitch laying goose eggs
Two fangs growing, got a toothache
Tie me up like a shoe-string, let the noose hang
Out of my box, I need a new frame
Ruby da Cherry ain't got a pocket full of fruitcake
Bruce Wayne wannabe
Fuck with me, I'll probably give you somethin' free
Honeys surroundin' around me because I'm buzzin' like a fucking bumblebee
Most of my raps are fucking tongue-in-cheek
Fungus in my lungs, dungeon reeks of crumbling weed
Another-another day, another fee
Pile of fucking dirt, you will find me underneath, yah, yah57Embed

Low Key Lyrics[Verse 1: RUBY DA CHERRY]
I got a drip, catch me duckin'
All of these bitches ain't fucking me, no
Can't hold a conversation with no one but my cousin
He tell me, "Don't worry, the money is comin'
These bitches is coming"
Yeah
The only question I got now, will I see it before I end up dug in the ground?
Lay low at the bottom of a tulip bed
They know Ruby got a lot of useless thread
Cut me open, let me rest, there ain't nothin' in my chest
A hollow cage that caused my death
I'm hauled away, just pause my breath

[Verse 2: YUNG $CARECROW]
Woke up dope sick with a cut wrist
Lil' bad bitch saying, "here's a plot twist"
When you cut it, you weren't even a little pissed
Just a grin on your face, saying, "watch this!"
Now I'm sittin' back thinkin' how sick am I?
But that went away the moment I got high
I'm saying now, "what it do, who are you?
Get the fuck out my living room
Get the fuck out my mental too
What, bitch? You can't hear when I talk to you?"
Now I'm back to square one, with my hand on the gun
Mama screaming, "Son, don't do it—I love you, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it"
I can't help this feeling
Don't you see that I need all these prescriptions?
This ain't no living
It's only a vision of the vicious cycle that is my addiction89Embed

Kill Yourself (Part IV) Lyrics[Verse 1: ROMEO DA BLACK ROSE]
They figure me a dead motherfucker
Romeo da Black Rose, sheddin' petals
Hold me over till they finish digging me a hole
I need a new beginning, so I tiptoe behind my foes, bitch
Unzip, I'm throwing it into that bitch's hole
Calling all my enemies the same place where that dick go
Fuck an online pussyboy talkin' shit
Acting like it was a brick thrown through a window
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me
Some slick hoes might catch me froze, but soon they will desert me
Get rich, blow that smoke in O's, don't ever act so thirsty
Sick diss though, fuck all this, slowly die before I'm 30

[Interlude: $LICK SLOTH]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2: $LICK SLOTH & Gry]
Isn't it so convincing how that blade slide 'cross my throat?
Coke residue all in my nose
Couple graves dug for my foes and it goes (Eyes, eyes)
On and on, my girlfriend calling my phone
Ain't seen her in about a week, this depression got me weak
Ever wake up every day and you want to die? (Death!)
Life going good, can't figure out why
Blank walls all around me, keep the pills nearby
Playin' with the nine, then I close my eyes
$uicide only thing gonna gratify this urge to leave
Can't you hear my plea? I'm down on my knees

[Outro: Gry]
Eyes, eyes (Tickle)
Eyes, eyes (Tickle)59Embed

Champion of Death Lyrics[Intro: YUNG PLAGUE]
Chump change, boy, now you gotta hate, boy
Pull up the with the motherfucking AK, boy
Pull up like it's motherfucking game day, boy
Shoot 'em with the pistol, shoot 'em point-blank, boy, yuh
Chump change, boy, now you gotta hate, boy
Pull up the with the motherfucking AK, boy
Pull up like it's motherfucking game day, boy
Shoot 'em with the pistol, shoot 'em point-blank, boy, yuh
Chump change, boy, now you gotta hate, boy
Pull up the with the motherfucking AK, boy
Pull up like it's motherfucking game day, boy
Shoot 'em with the pistol, shoot 'em point-blank, boy, yuh

[Verse 1: YUNG $CARECROW]
Product of the poison, you can bet your life on it
Teeth got the ice on it, wrist still got the slice on it
That walking stigmata and poltergeist
Still feelin' stuck every single night
Don't give a fuck if I live or die
Surprised to this point that I have survived
Pull up with the motherfuckin' AK tucked, bitchboy, good luck
Yung Plague got the blade, hit the slay
Then we spray with the .44 5
Bitch, it's Grey*59, let the devil go and ride
Ain't nothing but a pussy if you gon' throw shade
Fuckboy, I'm hungry, and you looking like steak
Trigger finger itching, and you looking like fake
Trash done passed and you looking like waste, yah
[Hook: YUNG PLAGUE]
Chump change, boy, now you gotta hate, boy
Pull up the with the motherfucking AK, boy
Pull up like it's motherfucking game day, boy
Shoot 'em with the pistol, shoot 'em point-blank, boy, yuh
Chump change, boy, now you gotta hate, boy
Pull up the with the motherfucking AK, boy
Pull up like it's motherfucking game day, boy
Shoot 'em with the pistol, shoot 'em point-blank, boy, yuh
[Verse 2: YUNG PLAGUE]
Tonight we guaranteeing graves, tonight's the night we ride
Tomorrow will never come, yeah, tonight's the night we die
Yesterday I met my death, I think it's been a long time
Stuck in limbo with my kinfolk, gave my life to $uicide
Yung Plague with the masked face
Bones will never break because I rape the souls of those who chose the wicked road, I'm haunting the afraid
No name on the grave, just grey stains spray-painted "slave to the great grey grave", ayy
Lend me the help, or send me to hell, either way I know I'll die
The G, the 5 the 9, it's $UICIDE

[Outro: YUNG PLAGUE]
Chump change, boy, now you gotta hate, boy
Pull up the with the motherfucking AK, boy
Pull up like it's motherfucking game day, boy
Shoot 'em with the pistol, shoot 'em point-blank, boy, yuh46Embed

Mount Sinai Lyrics[Intro: YUNG HEATH LEDGER]
Juul smokin' motherfucker, don't come around me with no vape
Got yo' bitch under the cover suckin' on me like a pipe
It's the hero of the dark, but I don't ever wear a cape
Take a Bic, and then I spark until the blunt evaporates

[Verse 1: YUNG HEATH LEDGER]
There ain't no debatin' with $uicide, two deep when I ride
Ruby gettin' high off of the pills that I supply
Just cruisin' by on flat tires in an '06 Chevy
Looking like I'm Bloody Mary, sippin' codeine and berry
I'm Donnie Darko when I spark up and I'm creepin' like Frank
Raisin' that choppa right at your face, and after that I go blank
'Cause $lickity off the hinges, with syringes, shootin' up my veins
Rather be left alone, I don't care to know your name, ho
[Bridge: YUNG PLAGUE]
Pull up in a Lamborghini just so you can see me
Swerve into a telephone pole, my skeleton broke
Pirellis smoke and burn
Put my ashes in a blunt and light the front, your vision's blurred
You might just learn how Ruby da Cherry has seen the world

[Verse 2: YUNG PLAGUE]
Watch me flex like I'm in the next life
Bitch, I was next in line for heaven
But then I ingested a double cup full of that fucking insecticide
Insects inside my dead body, ironically, after Oddy was identified
Possibly gotta be specified, 'cause the weather was intensified
Draggin' the lake
They made a mistake because Yung Plague was recognized
The sun turned black
The sky replaced by the face with giant reddened eyes
Christ cannot compare, he cannot save by breakin' bread and wine
$uicideboy$ can relate to the revelations because we dead inside57Embed

DIEMONDS Lyrics[Verse 1: RUBY DA CHERRY]
What I hate most in this life is a long night
Four walls and no calls, and no lights
But the moonlight creepin' through the blinds
Ceiling fan on high spinnin'
I'm beginning to believe that tonight is the night
Dead by dawn
I'll shred my palms to the end of my arm
I'm spread and gone, embalmed
Put me in the dirt where I belong
Existence is overrated anyway
Fifty years later, they won't remember you're dead
Six billion people living as civilians, and I hated them all
I should have been a vermillion reptilian living in a swamp
(At least I'd have scales to protect me from the pain)
[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH]
Enter the void with my wrist shackled up
Codeine and water that fill up my cup
Visuals glisten when I get fucked up
Rehab's for quitters and I don't give up
Cockin' the nine if you wanna act tough
This all by design, I don't have any luck
When it comes to them dollars, don't make me get buck
Hollow tip showers when I go and bust
Tell me the reason you wanna be us
I'll tell you good riddance and then get the fuck
Used to fuck bitches in back of the bus
Nothin' has changed, bitch, I'm still bustin' nuts
Always complainin' 'bout bitches and love
When I don't feel nothing, no, not even lust
Triple six demons, in Satan we trust
Killing these motherfuckers is a must50Embed
