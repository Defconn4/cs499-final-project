FEFE Lyrics[Intro: 6ix9ine, Nicki Minaj & Baka]
It's fuckin' TR3YWAY!
King of New York, lookin' for the Queen
Uh, you got the right one, hmm
L-let these-l-let these b-b-bitches know, nigga
Queens, Brooklyn, brrr, ah!
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Pussy got that wet, wet, got that drip, drip
Got that super soaker, hit that
She a Fefe, her name Keke
She eat my dick like it's free, free
I don't even know like "Why I did that?"
I don't even know like "Why I hit that?"
All I know is that I just can't wife that
Talk to her nice so she won't fight back
Turn around and hit it from the back, back, back
Bend her down then I make it clap, clap, clap
[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Draco got that kick-back when I blow that, they all do track
They don't shoot back, one shot, close range, red dot
Head tight, yeah, I did that, yeah, I live that
Call a Uber with my shooter, with a Ruger, we gon' do ya
Niggas say they killin' people, but I really fuckin' do it

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
He-he tryna 69 like Tekashi, call him papi
Word to A$AP, keep me Rocky, I'm from New York, so I'm cocky
Say he fuckin' with my posse, copped me Khloé like Kardashi'
Keep this pussy in Versace, said I'm pretty like Tinashe
Put-put it all up in his face, did I catch a case?
Pussy game just caught a body, but I never leave a trace
Face is pretty, ass for days, I get chips, I ask for Lay's
I just sit back and when he done, I be like, "Yo, how'd it taste?"
(Yo, how'd it taste?)
[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, Draco got that kick-back
When it kick-back, you can't get yo shit back
In fact this that bitch that
"I hate small talk, I don't fuck with chit-chat"
AC just stopped workin'
So they hit me, told me bring my wrist back
Come through rockin' fashions
That got all these bitches like "Yo, what's that?"
(Like "Yo, what's that?")

[Chorus: 6ix9ine & Nicki Minaj]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Bridge: 6ix9ine & Nicki Minaj]
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I catch a ho right by her toe
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that ho right through the door (TR3YWAY)
I don't really want no friends, my old ho just bought this Benz
Nicki just hopped in this shit, now I won't see that bitch again
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (no)
I catch a ho right by her toe (no)
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that ho right through the door (no, TR3YWAY)
[Outro: Nicki Minaj & 6ix9ine]
Mmm, Young Money, Young Money bunny

Talkin' 'bout the relish, I do not embellish
Jacket got wings, True's got propellers
Gave all my old Margielas to my boy Marcellus
Pulled up with no laces, had the whole block jealous

Wild nigga life, tell 'em read my rights
Man it hot tonight, lucky I wore my ice
15 in the game, baby girl, I got stripes (Huuh)

I was out in Spain rockin' a Medusa head
I ain't never have to give a rap producer head
If I do, though, I'ma write a book like Supahead
This ain't wonder that I'm makin', this that super bread
Splish, splash, fuck him in a hurry, quick, fast
Still a pink wig, thick ass, whiplash
Got him cummin', cummin', Roger, over, dispatch
Said my box is the best, he met his match
I got all these bitches wantin' to be Barbie dolls
Barbie Dreamhouse, pink and purple marble walls
Pull-Pull up in that Barbie 'Rari, finna bury y'all
She threw dirt on my name, ended up at her own burial

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
Kanye dressed me up like a doll
Then I hit 6ix9ine, tell him give me the ball

WAKA Lyrics[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Catch an asthma attack, the way we pull up on ya
Put the pump to his chest, make a nigga cough up
You a bum and you stressed, and that's why you lost her
Met a nigga from the X, niggas need to boss up
She gon' eat, you want beef, but this ain't no burger
All my songs on repeat, that's what's up, your word up
I was young with the heat, walkin' 'round with burners
Wishin' I could wish for anything like Timmy Turner

Na-na-oh, nah-oh
Na-na-oh, nah-oh
Na-na-oh, nah-oh

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Why this bitch tryna play me? Are you crazy?
Pocket rocket in my cargos, like the Navy
Put this Tommy to his brain, please, like he Brady
Heartbreakin' on the daily, can you save me?
Why is bitches tryna play me? Are you crazy?
I can't let her have my baby, you not my baby
I can't let her have my baby, I'm actin' shady
Heartbreaking on the daily, can you save me?
[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Y'all gotta move, give me some room, I'm 'bout to shoot
Boom! Everybody runnin' out the room
Boom! Everybody beggin' "Don't shoot"
Boom! Nigga, who the fuck asked you?
You a bum, are you dumb? Try me, I got this gun
Run, nigga, if I'm here, don't come
Bitch, you was expectin' for me to hit
That's a dub, I know you put a hole in that shit

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Sawed off in the damn drawer
Got the .30 in my drawers, gotta hold my pants up
Only time she ever call is for the banana
I don't even check my call log, I don't answer

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Why this bitch tryna play me? Are you crazy?
Pocket rocket in my cargos, like the Navy
Put this Tommy to his brain, please, like he Brady
Heartbreakin' on the daily, can you save me?

[Verse 4: 6ix9ine]
Why this bitch tryna play me? Is she crazy?
That bitch know I'm number one, like Tracy McGrady

I know all these niggas hate me, won't let it faze me
Fuck nigga
[Verse 5: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]

Pull up windows down in the fuckin' Lamb' truck

TIC TOC Lyrics[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Okay, tick tock, Audemars wrist watch
I keep a stick, I keep a big Glock
You get hit, I do not miss shots
I keep a stick, I tell her, "Kick rocks"
Okay, get rocks, wrist go drip, drop
I do not kiss, you making shit hot
You think I'm dumb, I ain't no kid
Thought you was in love
You ain't my bitch, nah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
She on my drip drop
She ain't never went both ways, but I made them lip lock
Left her at the condo for days, she was at the tip top
Might as well throw away the key, I got the streets locked
I been drinkin' all this lean, I know I need to stop
Hoppin' out of stolen cars, and we shoot chops at opps
Two flooded out Rolexes, they don't tick or tock
Lemme catch your lil' shorty, she gettin' picked apart
Everything up to par
[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
I got them big rocks in my ear, nuggets
I got my whole team flooded
Saks Off Fifth, I'm with your bitch
She buying everything I wanted
She fly me out to Waikiki
LV all on her bikini
Take her money, go Houdini
I call her when I want eat-eat
On my feet, you see them CC's
Neck and ears, you see them VV's
On my jeans, you see them GG's
Treat that bitch like she a fefe
Big body Benz, that's beep-beep
Hit it in the back of the Jeep-Jeep
That bitch know she a freak-freak
And the pussy staying on leak-leak

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Okay, tick tock, Audemars wrist watch
I keep a stick, I keep a big Glock
You get hit, I do not miss shots
I keep a stick, I tell her, "Kick rocks"
Okay, get rocks, wrist go drip, drop

Flew her back 'cause my girlfriend saw her
They tried to say I wasn't black no more
About as black as Macklemore
They don't like me 'cause I'm Mexican
Sent me back, now I'm back again
Uh, just bought a piece of Fashion Nova
Your girlfriend look like a ogre
Nigga, fat bitches need love too
My fault, Ye, I wasn't sober
Who the fuck gon' listen to Ebro? (Ebro)
All these niggas so emo
Fuck that nigga, I'm the mothafuckin' shit
Another old nigga on a young nigga dick
N-N-Niggas tried to say that I was canceled (Canceled)

Gotta stay ready for the smoke, 'cause niggas tryna take my soul

Thought niggas was my bros, but they changed though
Niggas don't know shit 'bout that
How the fuck a nigga switch like that?
Gotta ride with a stick 'bout that
Pull a grip from the hip like that
Keep it around me, I can't never lack
Niggas around me, they stay with the strap
Move from around me, or you could get whacked
I see an opp and I'm leavin' him flat, oh-oh

I can't sleep, just took 'em off the team
Had to break it down to three
Get on one knee
I prayed to the Lord that He'd watch my family
Thinking this bitch gon' wait on me
Thinking my fans remember me
Thinking my friends remember me
Nigga, don't switch up on me
Can't tell me shit, 'specially not no bitch
Ten for ten with this shit
I'ma still drop these hits, I'ma still pop my shit
Got a Draco with the kick

Ride around with that shit all on my hip
