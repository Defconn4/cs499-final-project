Pop the trunk, I open up

And my ho got talent, right?

And then dick her down, she gon' turn around
Then I'ma kick her out, she gon' talk that shit but still
Ayy, how you make it up? How you fake a love?
Holy son, I was the chosen one
I'm sippin' out the grail, she don't kiss and tell
She keep my wishes well, I don't need her, well
Oh, yeah, how my enemy a friend of me?
Why y'all feed off of my energy?
Like I ain't dead yet, higher entity
Foreign bitch that think she into me
Whip the foreign very viciously
Why these dudes wanna take pics with me?
She said she gay, but still into me
She said she gay, still into me
Said she hate that I'm in the streets
And I said I hate that I'm in the streets
I wanna blow up and make history
Said she hate my Insta' feed
[Chorus]
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you

Okay, so this little light of mine
Tattoos all down my spine
Everybody know that I'm on my grind
Always at a place where the sun don't shine
The media wanna make me a bad guy
I don't know if I'm happy, you're right
I stay inside and I pray up to Christ
Hopin' one day I don't end my life
Way too depressed to express how I feel
Only smoke weed, sometimes on pills
Shit's a nightmare, I don't know what's real
She came back around since I got that deal
I don't want friends, I want happiness
She did me dirty, it's fuck that bitch
I was so broke but now I'm rich
Still the same gang, still the same clique
Xanarchy shit, tell that ho, "Make a wish"
Feel the touch when we kiss
My hands on her hips, fell in love with her lips
Make her swallow my kids
The world is so evil while we lost in the mix
Tryna make it make sense
So I wanna know, does it matter to you
That I don't have no fucks to give? Bitch
[Chorus: Lil Xan, Lil Xan & Lil Skies]
Pray to God like Allah, please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die, please slit my throat

Xanarchy
Yeah!

[Verse]
Girl, you my everything
You deserve a wedding ring
Moving on to better things
Yeah, I get so jealous
But believe me, that's cos' I love you
And if I catch you with another dude, we end up on the news
Ayy, or better or worse, I know that love hurts
And my question if it's worth it, I said questions uncertain
What's the point if you gon' lie though
You don't have to hide yo
I know you was a hoe, but baby, we could fix that
Or maybe I should kick back
And fuck other bitches while she fucks other dudes, yeah, ayy
And while she fucks other dudes
Yeah, while these bitches send me nudes, yeah
[Chorus]
What's the point in falling in love, yeah
You just gonna lose, yeah
'Cause feelings really hurtin' now
I think I can't handle
Every year go by and I'm blowing out more candles
Waiting, waiting, waiting for the future
A future without you might be the future that I choose
How am I gonna fuck you when I know who you've fucked
I know the past is the past, but the past is so ba-a-ad
Yeah, ayy, so ba-a-a-a-a-ad
So bad
