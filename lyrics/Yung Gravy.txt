Turn these bitches on 'cause I'm really good at Bop-It
Clean in, clean out
Pullin' up drop top Viper (Ayy)

Finessed it like I'm Swiper (Ayy)
So much bread gotta get my fiber
Gravy, he be cleaner than your windshield wipers (Uh)
Your step-mom made me a pie

I don't eat the booty, I ain't even gotta say it
But I'll eat my girl's ass if she had a bad day (Ayy)
Gravy don't play
Bitch I'm at the bakery, them donuts gettin' glazed
Stay with three hoes like it's the holidays
Stuck to the bread, you would think I’m mayonnaise (Goddamn)

Cheryl Lyrics[Intro]
Any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
(Gravy Train)
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
Bitch

[Chorus]
Juice, sauce, little bit of dressing (Ooh)
Ice, wrist, little bit of flexing (Ayy)
Juice, sauce, little bit of dressing (Ooh)
Ice, wrist, little bit of flexing (Ayy)
I went to the store for some chocolate-flavored milk
Came home with a thick chocolate colored MILF
All she wanted was a little gravy train for Christmas
She was purely interested in giving me the business
[Verse 1]
Pretty sure I was like twenty when it happened (Flex)
Speakers playing Marvin Gaye, so I started snapping
All of a sudden mama had her ass clapping
We were in the aisle with the paper and the napkins (Ooh)
I was mesmerized by the way that it was shaking
Looked down at her cart and all she had was bacon (Oh)
Oh shit, I think she want some breakfast
But out the corner of my eye I saw my fuckin' dentist

[Chorus]
Juice, sauce, little bit of dressing (Ooh)
Ice, wrist, little bit of flexing (Ayy)
Juice, sauce, little bit of dressing (Ooh)
Ice, wrist, little bit of flexing (Ayy)
I went to the store for some chocolate-flavored milk
Came home with a thick chocolate colored MILF
All she wanted was a little gravy train for Christmas
She was purely interested in giving me the business

[Verse 2]
Guess it turned out that my dentist was her wife
Same dentist I had already piped thrice (Woah)
I'm not trying to pull up on your wife, girl, I promise
But it's starting to look a lot like Trapped in the Closet (Oh)
I was thinking about that masterpiece by R. Kelly
When suddenly my dentist started rubbing on my belly (Oh)
Looked down at her cart, she had the biscuits with the jelly
That's the time that Gravy hit a threesome in the deli (Huh)
Gravy got racks, and my baby got back
(Gang, gang, gang)
Serenade your bitch on the sax (Huh)
No slack in my mack, y'all better relax
At my crib (Ba-da-da-da), scented candles with the dirty sprite
R. Kelly playing while I lay that pipe
[Outro]
Ba-na-nuh-nuh-nuh
Posted with your bitch all night (All night)
I pull up with that pipe
I might
Pull up on your bitch, pull up with them shits
I might

This should be played at high volume (Bubby)
Preferably in a residential area
(Gravy Train)

Woke up in the morning 'round six
Two dark bitches on my side like Twix (Ayy)
Little vanilla in the mix
Don’t eat ass, but I’m still with the shits (Ooh)

Riding in the Fisker or the god damn Daewoo

And we're sitting pretty on the gravy train (Gravy Train)
And we sing every sweet refrain repeat

Pull up on yo bitch with my snorkel and my floaties
Then I hit her with the horizontal hokey pokey, ah shit
