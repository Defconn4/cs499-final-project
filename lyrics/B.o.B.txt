Headband Lyrics[Intro: B.o.B]
Mustard the beat, ho (Yeah, Bandz)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Already got one rolled up in my left hand (In my left hand)
Pussy on my mind, tighter than a headband (Than a headband)
Kush in my lungs, got ganja in my sweat glands (In my sweat glands)
This shit I'm on, better than the next strand (Ayy)
Than the next strand, better than the next strand (Ayy)
She head down, booty poppin' in a handstand (Bandz)
I shine bright, I'll give your girl a slight tan (Woo)
I make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man *Whistles*
I don't even understand, why she'd ever want a man
If she ever throw it, I'd catch it like a cornerback (Like a cornerback)
Like a cornerback, that's an interception (Interception)
You think I give a fuck? That's a misconception
[Refrain 1: B.o.B]
Oh, what a night (Yeah,) oh, what a night (Yeah)
The roof is on fire (Yeah,) so what? I'm high (Yeah)
I said, oh, what a night (Hey,) oh, what a night (Hey)
Yeah, she a bad bitch, all jokes aside (Woo)

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Hey, look at baby over there (Over there)
Wassup, lil mama, come here (Come here)
She started talking but I really couldn't hear (Ha)
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Do it in the mirror)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Uh, like she do it in the mirror

[Post-Chorus: B.o.B, 2 Chainz]
I chop one, chop two, chop that ass down (Down)
Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down
All I want you to do is just drop that ass down (Yeah)
Drop drop that ass down, uh, now look back at it (2 Chainz)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Whistling Dixie
Middle school, I was getting head on a ten-speed
Gigolo bloodline, pimpin' hereditary
Black on 28's, it remind of February
Day you can fuck with me, that would be Neveruary
Dead ass rapper should'a came with a cemetery
I am so cold, nigga like Ben & Jerry
Fill a nigga, deal a nigga, kill a nigga, obituary (Tell 'em)
My vision blurry, these bitches flirtin'
I been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin' (Damn)
So I closed the curtains on the 62
Her ass'll knock your ass out, you better stick and move (True)
Chain hang to my ding-a-ling (What?)
Chain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling (Yeah)
To do a threesome you gotta intervene
Her legs so sexy when I'm in-between
[Chorus: B.o.B]
Hey, look at baby over there (Over there)
Wassup, lil mama, come here (Come here)
She started talking but I really couldn't hear (Ha)
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Do it in the mirror)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Uh, like she do it in the mirror

[Post-Chorus: B.o.B]
I chop one, chop two, chop that ass down (Down)
Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down
All I want you to do is just drop that ass down
Drop drop that ass down, uh, now look back at it

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
She do it like she do it in the mirror
Be cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears
She speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears
I'm looking for the baddest one here, I tell her like
Do that there, do that there
You gotta stretch it out, girl, move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there
Like hut one, hut two, girl, who back there?
Who back there? I'm back there
I could take a step back and sip my cognac there
Picture perfect body, that's a Kodak there
Now make a nigga feel welcome like a doormat's there, I'm like
[Refrain 2: B.o.B]
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I'm like, oh, what a night, oh—oh, what a night
That's a bad bitch, all jokes aside, there she go (Woo)

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Hey, look at baby over there (Over there)
Wassup, lil mama, come here (Come here)
She started talking but I really couldn't hear (Ha)
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Do it in the mirror)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Uh, like she do it in the mirror

[Post-Chorus: B.o.B]

Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down
All I want you to do is just drop that ass down

Airplanes Lyrics[Intro: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night
[Chorus: Hayley Williams, B.o.B, Both]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes
[Chorus: Hayley Williams, B.o.B, Both]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Outro: B.o.B, Hayley Williams]
I could really use a wish right now (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
I, I, I could really use a wish right now (Mmm-mm-mm-mm)
Like, like, like shooting stars (Ahh-ah-ah-ah)
I, I, I could really use a wish right now (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
A wish, a wish right now90Embed

We Still In This Bitch Lyrics[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm in my zone, I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz, quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down about an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down about an hour ago
But we still in this bitch

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I pull up, pull up, pull up in that automatic cookup
B Rich pull up in that rooster 'til we wake the fucking hood up
Got all these pounds of ganja, I work out, I'm doing kushups
Bobby Bands is in the building, pop that pussy throw a foot up
In the air, one time for a nigga like me with a squad like this
With a team so strong with a flow so cold, ain't nothing but some bad bitches in my clique
What's up Eastside
We in this bitch
They think they seeing me
But they ain't seen shit
Girls on the pole yeah they make me rich
Girls at my shows wanna take my pic
Yeah we can do this here all night, can't tell me nothing, can't tell me shit
All in my zone, all on my own
Open that pack, rollin' that strong
And we still up in this bitch, won't turn down, won't go home
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I got big wheels on my ride, spent about six mills on my ride
You catch me swervin' all on your side of town bumpin' "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe"
Don't blow my high, just blow my cock, I'm so paid, I'm so fly
Your baby daddy disrespect me, black his eye, that's no lie
I'm on my square, blowing circles in the air, of that purple
I'm a boss and you a worker, listen here boy don't make me hurt you
You want trouble I got plenty, how you want it full or semi
I'm so rich so all that fuckboy shit you kickin' don't offend me
Don't get killed off in this bitch, I spent mills all on this shit
Boy it's been 11 years of this shit, look at me now still in this bitch
I stand tall no can fall, you pussy ass niggas can't touch a G
See me don't speak ain't' nothing G, I'm in my zone nigga don't fuck with me
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down

But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Juicy J stay in the club, me and all my niggas
All these bad bitches, all this free liquor
Surrounded by so many women one of these hoes might be your wife
She lookin' for a nigga that's ballin' so tonight might be her night
You know me I stay stuntin', lowkey I threw tuition at Onyx
Flip money fast like Sonic, rich nigga I speak ebonics
Got a new car I paid cash, got a new crib with a weed lab
Crisp bills I need that, fuck your team where the freaks at
Hundred deep in V.I.P., niggas always hatin'
I came in with a bunch of goons and I'm leavin' with out with his lady
I got your boo in my Bugatti, she bout to swallow my babies
My system loud my weed loud, no hair clippers I'm faded
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago

Airplanes, Pt. 2 Lyrics[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Post-Chorus: B.o.B]
Dreaming… of falling
Dreaming… of falling

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Tryin' to be the next rapper comin' out the A (A-Town)
Hopin' for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Sellin' out arenas with big-ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Okay, let's pretend like this never happened (Never)
Like I never had dreams of bein' a rapper (Rapper)
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes (Classes)
Like I never used to run away into the blackness (Yeah)
Now, let's pretend like it was all good (Good)
Like I didn't live starin' in the notebook (Notebook)
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should (Should)
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood (hood)
Yeah, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name (No)
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a. Bobby Ray
I'm talkin' back before the mixtapes (Cloud 9)
Before the videos and the deals and the fame (Yeah)
Before they ever once compared me to André (Three stacks)
Before I ever got on MySpace (Yeah)
Before they ever noticed my face (Yeah)
So let's just pretend and make wishes outta airplanes
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Bridge: B.o.B. & Eminem]
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone
They're just memories
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone
All right…
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things woulda been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
"Marshall, you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win."
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
"Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch!"
"You won't amount to shit—quit daydreamin', kid!"
"You need to get your cranium checked."
"You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic."
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
To the Rap Olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here, he pretends that—
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now69Embed

Out of My Mind Lyrics[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I'm out of my fucking mind, gee, gee, golly, oh my
I was doing fine, once upon a time
Then my brain left and it didn't say bye
Don't look at me wrong, I'm out of my mind
Like Nostradamus and da Vinci combined
So paranoid of espionage
I'm watching my doors and checking my blinds
My brain's on vacation, they telling me
And I'm bi-polar to the severity
And I need medication, apparently
And some Electroconvulsive therapy
I am a rebel, but yes, I'm so militant
Still, I'm illegible for disabilities
I am psychotic but there is no remedy
This is not figurative, this is literally
If these niggas go dumb, I go to the mental facility
See, man, I'm so out there, I slap fives with ET
I don't need a feature
They don't want me to eat à la carte when I'm on this beat
If you feel the same as me, then you got to agree
I'm out of my mind
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
What's your name? B.o.B?
So, they calling you Bob?
Stop playing, nigga, you know that I'm known for the 'Bob
Couple hit songs, got you thinking you a hearthrob
Well, this thang so good, make a nigga wanna sob (Hmm, hmm)
You don't need a feature?
Nigga, I'm the feature
You gon' be the priest, and I'ma be the preacher
You can be the He-Man, I'ma be the She-Ra
You can be the Grim, I'ma be the Reaper
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night skies
Are like shooting stars?
Well, you gon' really need a wish right now
When my goons come through and start shooting stars
You know, I'm all about shoes and cars
I'm kinda drunk off booze, Bacardi
I told Baby when I get my new advance
I'ma blow that motherfucker on a blue Bugatti
You know, I graduated summa cum laude
That's why they thinking I'm Illuminati
And matter fact, let's kiss and make-up
I'll help you escape on my blue Ducati
Hallelujah!
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

[Interlude: B.o.B]
I'm out of it
I can't seem to come out of it
What's going on inside of my head?
It feels like I'm being John Malkovich
Ladies and gentlemen, please tone it down a bit
There is an announcement, I'd like to announce (It...)
Wait, how am I suppose to pronounce this shit?

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I don't need a sub, I don't need a speaker
'Cause a nigga bring the noise like an onomatopoeia
Leave him in the dust, all he see is my Adidas
Na-na-na-na boo-boo, wouldn't want to be ya
Never turning back, how you think I got here?
And I'm never slowing down; fuck was that, a deer?
If you got a problem, step to the office
Matter fact, never mind, talk to the Kiosk, bi-atch
You have no idea
That's why they call me B-dot; been a maniac ever since I was knee-high
Man, I swear to God, I'ma need help
Someone call Charter; maybe call FEMA
'Cause I got to be crazy or outta my mind to have this many stamps on my VISA, vis-à-vis
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind
[Outro: B.o.B & Nicki Minaj]
Wait, if I'm here and you're there?
And I'm here and you're there? [repeats]
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And I'm here and you're there?
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And if I'm here and you're there?
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And if I'm here and you're there?
[Outro: Nicki Minaj (whispering)]
Yeah, you're right there, and here
Um, yeah, yeah (We're outta here)

Nothin’ on You Lyrics[Chorus 1: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say hi
And I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
(Yeah) Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
(Go, go, go, go)

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hey)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style, they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it

[Pre-Chorus 2: B.o.B]
I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)
Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)
But you always steal the show (Steal the show)
And just like that, girl, you got me froze (Got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well, now you know
(Know, know, know, know)

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted (Ha-ha)
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hey)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
[Bridge: B.o.B]
Everywhere I go
I'm always hearin' your name
And no matter where I'm at
Girl, you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane
Or a car or a train
No other girl's on my brain
And you the one to blame

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted (Why?)
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)

Magic Lyrics[Intro: B.o.B]
Hi, my name is B.o.B, and I approve this message

[Hook: Rivers Cuomo]
I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I got the magic in me
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line (Ah!)
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes? (Right there)
Come on down to the front and stand right here and don't be shy (Bobby)
I'll have you time travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryin' to inherit the skill, so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes and
I see Mindfreak like "What's up man, what's happenin'?" (Mindfreak!)
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight (Ha)
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9, haha
[Hook: Rivers Cuomo & B.o.B]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
We'll take a journey into my mind, you'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd (Ah)
See, see, when I rhyme, I flow on the beat like pitta-da-da
See, I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether (Yeah)
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave ya with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel (Yeah!)
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you sayin', it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

[Hook: Rivers Cuomo & B.o.B]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me
[Outro: B.o.B, B.o.b & Rivers Cuomo]
Ayy, that, that, I got that
Ayy, I got the magic in me
Ah-ha-ha
I, I, I, I, I got the magic in me29Embed

Strange Clouds Lyrics[Intro: B.o.B]
Yeah, eh-hahaha
Oh, you already know what we gon' do
Eh-hahaha
Hey

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well, if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly
I just stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian
And um, I'ma hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan
Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians
You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally
I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is
The way I ride on the beat, man, I beat every street
It's done so effortlessly
Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me
There's no Inception in this
[Refrain: B.o.B]
Bitch, I'm top chef, you top ramen, I'm top shelf
No last call to the bartender, "What you got left?"
Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah
All night we celebrate 'cause we everywhere and you not there, ha

[Chorus: B.o.B, Lil Wayne]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
Strange clouds (Yeah)
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do) (Haha!)
And all we do is light it up all night (Yeah, yeah)
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
Strange clouds

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, blue jeans, I'm faded, mining my own data
Smokin' on that strong, that Arnold Schwarzenegger
It's Tunechi Li, you bitch, you, you hot as a igloo
Kick back on that Glock, call that Jiu Jitsu
Hello world, I'm with a yellow girl, number two pencil
These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you
My nigga, all day, all night, half-pipe
I dive in that pussy, ya, I belly flop, I jack knife
[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
And shit, tell my homies that I say it's a party
Yeah, got that TEC for technical difficulties
I'm top dog, you top ramen, I'm top dog
Piru, gangsters, outlaws!

[Chorus: B.o.B & Lil Wayne]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out (Yeah!)
(That's all we do, that's all we do) (Young Mula, baby!)

All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
Strange clouds, strange clouds, strange clouds

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Well, ain't no question, yes, it's B.o.B, yes, definitely
Up in the studio, I got all my necessities
If you want that real shit, you made the right selection (Haha)
I'm Decatur 'til I die (Yeah), yes, I rep that definitely
They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I say it's a curse, but it's been mostly a blessin'
To a nigga from the hood, tryin' to aim for the top
I didn't even need no directions
[Refrain: B.o.B]
I just wake up and then I roll up the purp
But these niggas wake up on my dick
At least have some breakfast first (Hey)
Nigga, keep your nourishment first
And your mind on my lyrics
'Cause what you hopin' to accomplish
I already did it, bitch!

[Chorus: B.o.B]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we, that's all we do, hey)
And all we do is light it up (Hey) all night
All you see is strange clouds (Hey)
(Strange clouds) Strange clouds, bitch!
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (All you see is, all you see)

Bombs Away Lyrics[Intro: Morgan Freeman]
As the war between light and darkness continues
Heroes and villains become harder to identify
Kindred spirits separated at birth
Fighting for their place in time to be solidified
The clock ticks faster and faster
While time runs a marathon in this Babylon
But see, the end is only the beginning
The beginning of the calm before the storm

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I used to dream of success, now success is inadequate
It seems the bigger I get it's the more they get mad at me
Cause there ain't no rules inside this fight that we battling
And it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it
And I swear it's like a fucked up reality
But creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate
I guess, and I ain't too big on duality but
You think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me
So fly: no gravity, so high: Mount Everest
And the show must go on, yes, but I don't have to act in it
And they don't make a television that handles the frequencies
Of my channel and there ain't no computer that can hack it
It just don't have the capacity, hell nah, that ain't happening
You hustle? Well we are Grand Hustle, nigga, we mastered it
Y'all working on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes
Drink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we catholics
And if this is an embassy, consider me ambassador
Official, no artificial preservatives or additives
I love it all but I ain't attached to it
They call this a game because it is exactly
[Hook: B.o.B]
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
And it seems like in the grand scheme of it all
The world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all
How do they exist if we don't know who they are?
They can be you, they could be me, they could be queens and gods
Some say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all
From a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve
But if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed
And whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge
Fuck rules, fuck bars, you can be whatever you want
You could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold
And in the springs, on the falls, you could never see it all
If you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls?
Man I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far
Now I be beasting up on these bars
Freak out a beat and then beat it out raw
Good God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety
I won't need viagra nah, even if I had a dog
I be the canine, I'd have a ball
Better watch out when you cross my yard
I am a flame, I am the spark
I am in drive, y'all are in park
Look at my shot, look at the arc
Look at the crowd as soon as I start
Look in they eyes and look in they hearts
Two middle fingers straight at the law
Sincerely yours, so pray to your lord
Cause this is a war, ain't talkin' 'bout bullets and swords
UFOs don't make any noise
When they travel in hyper speed, so welcome aboard
[Hook: B.o.B]
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)

[Outro: Morgan Freeman]
As the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity
Unveiling the grim reality of duality
In which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt
Truth has many shades
It's not a matter of black and white, but gray
Although many, we are one, so in the final analysis
Could it be that we are fighting a war that can't be won?29Embed

So Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good
[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

[Verse 2]
Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good
[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good

[Verse 3]
Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should

Flatline Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, you ain't seen my best
Checkmate, ain't a game of chess
Globalists see me as a threat
Free thinking, got a world at my neck
Hah, am I paranoid? Picture Malcolm X
In a room full of pigs, trying not to bust a sweat
Aye, Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest
They probably write that man one hell of a check
Aye, I'm over here on this side of town
Come on over, over, over, over here, try to clown
Aye, I never pipe down
If they weren't coming for me then
They definitely coming for me now
I can't even keep my phone charged up
All this shit I'm talking, I should get my home barred up
Rappers get off of my dick and get your own bars up
Now the mirror lizard's breath got the clones scared cuz
Woo, use your, use your common sense
Why is NASA part of the department of defense?
They divided up the seas into thirty-three degrees
Feeding kids masonry, bruh, be careful what you read
[Hook 1]
Flat line, flat line
There's no superior blood line
Flat line, flat line
You got me once but that died, aye

[Verse 2]
Voice, voice, do I have a voice?
Do I give a fuck? Do I have a choice?
Joint, joint, I roll up a joint
Keep my shooters in the game like I hate to disappoint
I see only good things on the horizon
That's probably why the horizon is always rising
Indoctrinated in a cult called science
And graduated to a club full of liars
Heliocentrism, you were the sixth victim
Fuck you and your team, you can sit on the bench with 'em
They nervous, but before you try to curve it
Do your research on David Irving
Stalin was way worse than Hitler
That's why the POTUS gotta wear a kippah
I'm a man first 'fore an artist
Get a lawyer, look up Doctor Richard Sauder

[Hook 2]
Flat line
You fooled us for the last time
Flat line, flat line
There's no superior blood line
[Interlude: Neil Tyson]
So you want to find the farthest point from that center. And it turns out sea level at the equator is farther away from the center of the Earth than sea level near the poles. It has nothing to do with global warming and melting of the ice caps

(Why is that?)

Because... Earth, we know it spins, once a.... day. Yes, thank you. Three people know that, how long a day lasts here

(Good for row number two, they're off to a great start)

So you, so you spin, you know when you spin pizza dough, it kind of flattens out. It gets wider in the middle and...so Earth, throughout its life, even when it formed, it was spinning, and it got a little wider at the equator than it does at the poles. So it's not actually a sphere, it's an...it's oblate, it's officially an oblate spheroid. That's what we call it. But not only that, it's slightly wider below the equator than above the equator

(A little chubbier?)

Little chubbier, chubby's a good word, it's like pear-shaped. So it turns out the pear-shapedness is bigger than the height of Mount Everest above sea level

[Hook 2]
Flat line
You fooled us for the last time
Flat line, flat line
There's no superior blood line

John Doe Lyrics[Intro: Priscilla Renea]
Seems like your heart stops workin'
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're
Taking a smoke break, you
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doin'
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just 'cause you got somewhere to go, so
You take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've
Got a prescription, you
Got an addiction
Who do you think that you're foolin'?
[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Ah
Errybody's addicted to somethin'
Errybody got a grip onto somethin'
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or somethin' to find
You struggle in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
The people that you work with notice the signs
When you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence
You say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hidin'?
[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah
I probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...
I mean, had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her "Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!"
Well at least I admit it
'Cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it
Well I ain't no different, I love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women
I spent so much time as a underground artist 'cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge you become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now I can see it, it's optical
[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Both of Us Lyrics[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Uhh
Ever thought about losing it
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
But you still can’t find no food in it
That’s foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is a uphill battle
But y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just askin'
What’s the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain’t a number one draft pick
Most of us ain’t Hollywood actors
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
For all the times no one’s ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like you’re just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us27Embed

Ray Bands Lyrics[Hook: B.o.B]

She wants them Ray Bands cause them bands are gorgeous
She looking for a sponsor and I ain't talking corporate
She after that endorsement
Ever since she saw me on the Forbes list
She be getting zero's from heroes
They're Zorros with horses
That's mustangs and porsches imported from Japan
She from Atlanta but she on that Cali strain
That's that overseas money, call 'em Taliban(ds)
She WMD, all year spring to winter
So pencil her in for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner
Ain't no incidentals
She want them bands like a freelance parade (All day)
Compliments of Bobby Ray

Quit being annoying, do something useful and roll a joint
You see business over bullshit's my company policy
And my team's going green and I ain't talking 'bout pottery
You tryin' to hit the party, she tryin' to hit the lottery
And if they watchin' girl, you're grandfather clockin' it
I don't pop bottles, I got pop dollars
After Strange Clouds, I'ma drop my rock album
Violent bravado, call me Bobby Bravo
Every play is crucial, yeah that's my motto

[Break: B.o.B]
Said wassup, yeah we do this all the time
Where the real freaks who wanna have a good night?
If ya feel that, let it go it's alright
The music got you movin' and you're losin' your mind
So let me know if it's alright
I just wanna know, shawty, have a good time
So why don't you let go, let go
You're losing control
The music got you movin' and you're losing your mind

Nothing at all, nothing on you
I just wanna show you a table for two
All you did was go on a date with a dude
You know he don't fit, he ain't tailored for you

Ready Lyrics[Intro: Future]
Apply major pressure my nigga
You hear me?

[Hook 1: Future]
Money on my mind, can't take it off that shit
A nigga's got five different iPhones
I only pick it up for that grip

Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas

While you're hating, we're somewhere in Abu Dhabi
With Arabians G5'in, and with my posse
It's outrages, on that good Jamaican
That's right I'm too faded, you're two shaded
I'm too greedy with two ladies
Excellence I'm exuberating
I'm finna smash like two potatoes
I don't give a fuck, not even two maybes
I turn up on niggas like rutabagas
I do it daily, I do it daily
That's my swag, you should pay me
Ain't that the truth?
This is my whip, ain't that the coupe?
Hustle Gang ain't that the squad?
Bitch, act like you've got a clue
While they out here catching feelings, I'mma catch a flight or two
I just give her major pressure while she gave me major (ooooh!)

[Hook 2: Future]
Money on my mind, can't take it off that shit
They've got five different iPhone's
Always picking up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Anything they wanna do, hell yeah I'm ready for it
Sexy bitch, just throw that back, hell yeah she's ready for it
They thought that the boy was stool, now my shit, they're checkin' for it
And your girl, she's addicted to it, I think that ho needs Betty Ford
All I heard was "that boy's pop"
All I heard was "that boy's not"
Top 5 on any list, but I've moved up by five slots
I'm passed one, high as fuck
I don't see niggas until I look down
I've just turned my crib in to the hookah spot
You are now welcomed to the kush lounge
So miss me with that fuckery
Girl, come here with that suckery
Ham Squad, Hustle Gang, that's that Underground Luxury
I don't mess with them fake types, I'd ban hem all, if it was up to me
Even if a bitch was a cashier, still she'd never get a buck from me

[Hook 3: Future]
Money on my mind, can't get off that shit
They've got five different iPhones
Always picking up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready23Embed

Play for Keeps Lyrics[Hook]
How much must I repeat? We only play for keeps
No time-outs, no free throws, no refs, no penalties
No handouts, no pit stops, no cheat codes, no sleep
But the drinks are on us, if you with it then pull up a seat

[Verse 1]
When you’re roaming through the jungle talk is nothing, talk is cheap
Time is money, money is power, power corrupts eventually, damn
So what are the options? What are the choices left for me?
What other rule is left to break? I guess my fate is a quest for me
Man I’m a dog that ain’t got no leash
Man got a crib, it ain’t got no lease
Man got a flow that ain't got no brain
But I still get brain, no hands no teeth, uh
Nowadays, niggas are killas on the beat
But where I was raised all of the killas was down the street
Better do your research
Feeling like I fell out of the sky and landed feet first
My squad go hard, my squad go concrete, watch my team work
Hell yea, you can tell that the boy finna eat cause I took my seat first
3 course meal, full entrée, refills and I want my dessert
So why not make a toast? Tomorrow could always be worse
Now keep them bottles coming by the kiloliter
And get that Ana off your chest, try to keep a clean shirt
I’m so Grand Hustle, you ain’t even in my league sir
What’s up with these nerds?
They be out here, gettin’ their salads tossed, gettin’ their leaves turned
The game just ain’t what it used to be, the quality is blurred
But a dying breed survives and a dynasty emerged
So put it in the air if you entirely concur
She call me hippie cause I live without any concern
Up on this green earth, I’m on them green herbs
Yeah yeah, yeah, I stay in them trees like the Keeblers
And they say that I look higher in person
As a kid I played in the yard, but now I’m astro turfing
I lived the actual version of the fantasies they utter
Made up stories of threesomes, they must just be seeing double
Run for cover, here comes trouble
My heart is going cold so I gotta sleep with warmer covers
Polar bear pimpin’, solar flare spittin’
Somebody tell ‘em that this is professional stuntin’, don’t attempt it
Society is twisted, they tryna take us under
So when you see them folks, don’t forget to warn a brother
I made it out alive but still the battle is a struggle
Veni, vidi, vici, I came, I saw, I conquered
They mad cause I murdered the game
And their name wasn’t in the will
You see, most of these haters are mad rappers who just still waiting on a deal
And they jealous of my success cause my shoes cost more than a bill
But I’ll never sit down at another table unless I’m invited to the meal
To some it’s like conquering mountains, to me it’s like stepping on hills
Remember the images in your mirror can be bigger than they appear
And the truth can be hard to swallow, depends on the size of the pill
And by the looks it’s about the time that you had your prescription filled
My life, full length feature presentation
There are no intermissions, no time for commercial breaking
A fighter in his prime, a legend in the making
There’s no debating when you let your numbers make the statement

One thing I can't stand is a petty hoe (Petty hoe)
Can't keep your business to yourself, don't go to tellin' folks

Don't wanna see her with a telescope, tell her go

How 2 Rap Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now open your mind up and listen you niggas
I am the master, the guru and after I school you I'm skinning you niggas
You finished, I'm making chinchillas out niggas
You should be embarrassed some banging pop rapper is killing you niggas
Consider this tax for the swag that my city has given you niggas
And I know I'm the man, no, I don't need no Grammy award on my mantle
Know it don't matter, the beat it don't matter, the style, any flow I can channel
You see I'm from Atlanta, east side of Decatur, I grew up on Candler
If you notice the way that I talk is vernacular, this is my actual grammar
I got these niggas nervous cause whatever lane that I'm in I'mma handle
Your lyrics are wack and emotionally shallow
You lost in my thoughts, you don't know how to paddle
I know that I'm shining, I know that I'm shining
Don't worry cause you can find shade in my shadow
From my point of view there's so many dead rappers
Shit, all we need is a memorial banner
My first mixtape, they all said I sounded like Dre
Then they said my album was pop, didn't really sound like the mixtape
Now I'm doing what I started, now they telling me I changed
I hear underrated so much you would swear it was my name
Ain't no rappers on my list
Come holla at me when you're done riding each others dick
25 million singles worlwide, I'll guess I'll take another hit
Matter of fact I find this rap shit boring, man I'm over it
Give me my guitar pick, I'll show you shit14Embed

No Future LyricsMmm, hey, I eat it like dinner
You see this shit I gotta deal with from these beginners?
I ain't circusin' around with these clown-ass niggas
You snappin' at the heels of a world class sprinter
Some may call this bullyin', some may call this bossin'
Check the letter, man, you know I'm All City varsity
Walk up on my field, you will get carried off it
We gon' need a body bag and we gon' need a coffin
Who am I battling? I ain't even exhausted
You can call me sick, you can even call me nauseous
A sea of great whites, you are a dolphin
If I was you, I would be a little more cautious
I'm way too high for you to look at
The future ain't lookin' promising for these rookies
This is target practice but I don't even pull the fucking trigger anymore
Cause it's just a waste of bullets
Come and get these pussies, wipe them off the flo'
I'm guessing they was hoping for some different results
I'm guessing they was guessing cause they wasn't really sure
But fuck it, I guess I'mma have to let these niggas know
So I think it's time for these haters to get off my dick
Got my own city, you can call it Bobtropolis
East side representers reppin' with authority
And I ain't talking congressmen and I ain't talking politics
Lookin' for freaks, freaks lookin' for sausages
But we already know that, so that is all to get
Check the name tag, you know who the roster is
ATL brand, Hustle H.A.M squad in this bitch
Like I ain't never had a mic
Fresh to death, I see you in the afterlife
I eat bars, eat beats for my appetite
You wouldn't know about that, you never had a bite
What I gotta do to get some solidarity?
Apparently, I need to speak with some more clarity
No luck needed, know no charity
And I'mma grown man, don't need pussy to take care of me
B to the O, I said it once befo'
If I ain't on your channel, go and look for the remote
Already graduated, yeah, you see the cap and robe
But now you couldn't see me 'less you had a telescope
I'm Bedrock bumpin', three strikes sumpin
Call me Jack-o-Lantern, I get head like pumpkins
It's nothin', roll up the stuffin'
Put it in the oven, get baked like muffins
If you ain't know, I guess I have to introduce ya
To my side of town, somethin' you ain't really used to
Body blow, uppercut, I do more than bruise ya
Keep fuckin' with me and you ain't gon' have no future13Embed
