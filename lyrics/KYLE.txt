​iSpy Lyrics[Intro: KYLE & Lil Yachty]
Man, fuck
What's wrong Kyle?
Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see, you see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah...
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for
[Verse 1: KYLE]
I ain't been gettin' high
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly (Yeah)
I noticed, you think that you know shit (Why you know?)
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it (Throws it)
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus (Out of focus)
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit (Woo!)
Otay, pray them niggas go away (Go away)
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil (Soleil)
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it (Yup), he don't say it, he shows it (Yup)
I'm just like DeRozan (Yup), if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin' (Yup), get 'em so wet they need coasters (Facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (Facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted
I ain't frowned since '06, I ain't cried since '01
My pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: KYLE]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
[Post-Chorus: KYLE]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
She said she 21, I might have to ID that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screenin' out the lane
Went from "Damn, this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber
[Chorus: KYLE]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Post-Chorus: KYLE]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I209Embed

Don’t Wanna Fall in Love Lyrics[Intro: Jane Child]
Ain't no personal thing

[Verse 1]
Uh, what's up?
Aw, damn it, baby you bad
Yeah, yeah, yeah, heard you got a boyfriend
That's cool girl, where is he at?
Oh, he fucked up
You lucked up
You done ran into the motherfuckin' man
I'm gonna make you my bae for a day
He should be happy I'm giving you back
'Cause I can make you wifey for a week
We can spend a weekend in Japan
If anyone fuck with my akachan
Tell em' they'll get fuckin' Jackie Chan-ed
Honestly I'm better as your boy
I'd be kinda shitty as your man
Let's go back to only being friends
Sorry girl, I hope you understand
[Chorus: Jane Child & KYLE]
It's just that
I don't want to fall in love (No, no) (Nope)
Love cuts just like a knife (That's right)
You make the knife feel good (Baby) (So good, so good)
I’ll fight you 'til the end (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I don't want to fall in love (No, no) (Nah, haha)
Love cuts just like a knife (That's right)
You make the knife feel good (Baby) (So good, so good)
I’ll fight you 'til the end (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

[Bridge: KYLE & Jane Child]
I wasn't leading you on girl (No, no)
I just forgot where I was goin'
I got way too attached (Baby)
That wasn't the plan
And I knew a girl just like you once (You once)
We ended up hating each other
'Cause we couldn't let it end (No, no)
That can’t happen again, no

[Chorus: Jane Child]
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
[Verse 2: KYLE]
Someone put em up, ding-ding-ding
Pulling on my heart strings, zing-zing-zing
But I’m trying to let go
But it's hard enough to leave you alone
With the phone goin', “Ring-ring-ring“
Please let me go
'Cause I don’t want to fall in love
'Cause the last time left me cold
When she left my house, she didn’t even let me know
Nigga she ain’t even leave me notes
Part of the reason I’m easily hurt
Part of the reason I’m leaving you first
Pardon that, part of me give my apologies
I know that working on it never works
And I’m sorry it’s you, but hey what should I do?
Be happy with lies? Or be sad with the truth?
Don’t be ashamed you see love is a game and I still want to play
I’m just too scared to lose and I know you are too

[Chorus: Jane Child & KYLE]
I don’t wanna fall in love (No, no)
(But it's, it's good, you know?)
Love cuts just like a knife
(I mean we're young, we don't need to be all tied down)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
(Yo, yo,  honestly fuck this shit, um, yo let's just boogie, alright?)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end53Embed

Doubt It Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, she trippin'
She don't know she fuckin' with King Wavy
Wave, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know something only I know
I got super powers but that's something only I know
What I want is mine if I say it in my mind though
Teach you if I had time, yeah, do I got the time? No
Shit these niggas dream about is not even a milestone
Call up Dr. Seuss, I think they running out of rhymes though
Jugging and finessing, we've heard that a hundred times though
Niggas keep repeating theyself like they in a vine
In a vine, in a vine though
Why they gotta lie, though?
Say them diamonds dancing homie, we know that it's rhinestones
I don't got a 'rari but my whip is really mine though
I don't got no thotties but I know my bitch is fine though
I'm from California, you can tell just by my Vans
My nigga's about it, you can tell just by his stance
Don't throw no subliminals or he'll be throwing hands
My bro-bro play baseball, I hope you know how to catch
I just heard my cue, ooh, they know I'm up next
Curly headed cute cute, she send me the text
Yeah, I been the dude dude since I made a YouTube
Fuck a million views, needed views somewhere floating like I'm Mewtwo
[Chorus]
Zoning in California on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it
Zoning in California on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it

[Verse 2]
Haircut like the 80's, yeah
Don't need a Mercedes
To maneuver Uber everywhere
Bank account like ...wait
Let's not even take it there
My career don't make it fair
Ain't no elevator to success, I had to take the stairs
How you think I made it here? Climbin', climbin'
How you think you make it here? Grindin', grindin'
I chase after what I want and I don't stop to take a breath
You can't run up on me, yeah
You need to take baby baby baby baby baby steps
Who you think you playin' with?
Nigga I'm a gamer, yeah, you should check my gamer tag
Fire spittin' kid, and who you kiddin'? I will flame your ass
Call of Duty champion, do you know who you aimin' at?
Nigga, you my son, fuck around and I'll rename your ass
Give you to adoption, make your mama come reclaim your ass (Bruh)
Well, I guess that's a little harsh
But everyone can't be a star
Sometimes niggas gotta read they script and play they part
Aw man damn, why is that so hard?
I don't know, I don't know, man
I just want to play Assassin's Creed
Give my baby what she needs
And watch my HBO shows in peace
Peace
[Chorus]
Zoning in California on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it
Zoning in California on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it42Embed

Keep It Real Lyrics[Verse 1]
A'ight look
Ever since I was thirteen
I been surrounded by hurt dreams
And fake niggas who threw shots, but none of that shit could hurt me
Police investigations, but the police couldn't chirp me
High school, couldn't nerf me
The New boyz couldn't jerk me
Aye!
Hey wake up like everyday
Someone got something to say
They all N.W.A.'s
Niggas ain't gettin' no play
Not in my city, no way
Go outside, get some sun, grab some shade
Hydroplane!
Niggas can't keep in they lane
It ain't no thang
My shit so biggity, biggity bang!
Yup!
Bang nigga!
K-I doing my thang nigga
Young boy he done upgrade from that Cavalier to that Range, nigga
Best believe I'm that same nigga
K.i.D but don't play, nigga
You're lowkey like Japan, dude
All you look the same, nigga
Dude, this is the shit I do
Spell it out for these dumb niggas, haiku
Weak rappers like you, are so bad for my mood
Bet, y'all better watch your step
Asians kid test
I'm coming correct
Really there's no contest
Getting it right till there ain't shit left
[Chorus]
Uhh, well I keep real and I don't think I'll ever, change
I'll never lie if you could look me in the, face
I swear to God that weak shit isn't in my, veins
I'll never change

[Verse 2]
Aight look
Real nigga since day one
So fuck you if you hate me
Been a working nigga since day two
And a rich nigga since day three
Learned this shit on my own,so
What the hell could you teach me?
Kyle Harvey's no clone, you
Couldn't see me with HD
With a telescope
With a microscope
Nigga in the dark
With a lot of phones
I'm over rappers who smoke weed with white girls, and get Emma Stoned
I'm not saying they're weak
I'm just saying they're not me
And if like, I'm fuckin' great
I mean like, what else could they be?
Ya know?
They say that I sound like Drake
I don't
Your daughter thinks I'm great
I know
Your motherfuckin' CD package needs to come with a bar of soap
Cause honestly, your verses stink
That shit puts me straight to sleep
Even if I didn't have a nose, I could tell that your verses reek
But its filled with all this shit about
Spots you've never been
And about
Girls you'll never do
And about shit you never did
And all the niggas you killed
And all the caps that you've peeled
Well all you niggas are millionaires, so come on, let's be real
[Chorus]
Uhh, well I keep and I don't think I'll ever, change
I'll never lie if you could look me in the, face
I swear to God that weak shit isn't in my, veins
I'll never change
I keep it real, (Keep it real, nigga)
I keep it real, (Keep it real, nigga) my nigga
I keep it real, (Keep it real)

I keep it real, (Keep it real, nigga)
That's how I feel, my nigga
This beat is real
Uhh, well I keep and I don't think I'll ever, change
I'll never lie if you could look me in the, face
I swear to God that weak shit isn't in my, veins

Focus On You Lyrics[Chorus]
You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say

[Verse 1]
Well hey girl, it's so insane girl
I'm so in love with all of the things you say girl
But hey girl I know this is like sorta like crazy
But if I could, and you could, then we could, like maybe
Surpass expectations and give a demonstration
Of a committed relation to our loveless generation
And if you do, you can be mine
And if you don't it's totally fine, I'll just accept that I'm a dweeb
Proceed to go home in my room and cry
I'll close the door and I'll ignore the fact you're into other guys
And I'll wash away the pain with a million tears I cry
But if you do (nah), oh baby if you do
I would like to give my entire life to you
[Chorus]
You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say

[Verse 2]
Hey, wait, hold on, wait
Okay, let me fucking say what I have to fucking say
See I think that you're great, and a gift given from God
Now I believe that God is love and my love is what you are
And you know that it's true, and as pretty as you are
Focusin' on every flaw, every wrinkle, every scar
And everything that you aren't
And the prettiest thing of all is that your nose is not fake
And your boobs are no facade
Baby, you truly are just everything that you are
And that's perfect
Because a silicon soul and a polyester heart
Makes the light inside kinda dark, yeah
[Chorus]
You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say54Embed

Sex & Super Smash Bros. Lyrics[Produced by Deaf Heff]

[Verse 1]
Hey girly, whatcha name is?
Ass so fat but that waist so famish
It's all goody as long as I get a woody
You can peck peck with your neck, aw baby
Implantations, that's amazing
Where are you from? Why aren't you famous?
Bet you didn't know that my whip ain't rented
Bet you didn't know that my clothes expensive
Bet you didn't know that my girlfriend Cuban
Bet you didn't know that I don't know Spanish
No habla ingles but she wants my penis
Wait, wait remix!
[Chorus]
What's the hold up?
Take your clothes off
There's a game
In the pillows
Or on Nintendo
It don't matter, we can play
Come on, girl, let's play a game
Sex and Super Smash, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros

Told me she just might though, be nice though
Come by the new place and spend the night though
We can go all night though, with no lights though
Want me to lay the pipe though, alright though
Told me she just might though, be nice though
Come by the new place and spend the night though
We can go all night though, with no lights though
Want me to lay the pipe though, alright though

[Verse 2]
She wants me to stay close though, Yeah I know so
Me and her are taking photos minus clothes though
Know I got a little dough though, more than most though
We can be on a boat with mimosas
Flow got 'em all wet though, get a coaster
Got girls from posters trying to post up
Told her it's all good though to come over
She wanna learn how to work my controller

Remember Me? Lyrics[Verse 1: KYLE]
Yeah, okay well hey yo remember me?
The one you used to rarely meet
Yeah I was just on BET, didn't see? No?
Just something I thought about
Probably happy you know a lot of kids that you fucked off and forgot about
But not this, not what this all about
There is more than that to it
Look I know we've both been through it but
You've been doing anything but what you should be doing like
When I call you on Christmas and you come with excuses
And tell me how you're sorry Kyle but this year I'm Jewish
But last year you was Hindu, and the year before was Buddhist
To keep from buying me clothes, I bet you'll probably be a nudist huh?
Probably have my moms on Maury, asking them to prove it
So I put my face on albums so you'd have to face the music
And when I think about it, it couldn't have been that hard
I didn't need the money man, I just wanted the card
But you was always busy or like somewhere hella far
And ever since I made it, it seems like you never are
That's weird
[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory

[Lady]
August 24th, 2013 Journal entry 87
The past is just a story we tell ourselves
Do you remember ours?
Tell me the story would you please?
[Verse 2: KYLE]
Yeah, hey look the happy rapper's not so happy now
I remember when I used to laugh out loud
Nowadays I only LOL
Through text cause I don't wanna talk
Don't touch me I don't wanna feel
Rewrote this verse a couple times
First time I kept it way too real
Back before droppin "Keep It Real"
You really dropped me on my ass
I sent a hundred thousand text's
Don't think you ever sent one back
Let's backtrack back to twenty twelve
Packed our backpacks and hit the road
Felt like I died and went to heaven
My life at home was living hell
I told you, you was all I had
It's funny then you couldn't tell
When all your friends was talking shit
It's funny then you couldn't smell
It's funny then you couldn't spell
When I got no answers to those texts
These things get harder to forgive, and even harder to forget
But when I think about it, I'm kinda glad that you did
Don't try to eat with me now
You couldn't starve with me then
A couple months ago fuck
It was hard for us to be friends
Your heart is so much bigger ever since I made it big
Man that's weird
[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright

I'll re-jog your memory15Embed

Just a Picture Lyrics[Intro: Kyle]
Mhm, oh yeah, gratata
This is a real ass problem and it should be taken seriously, ok?

[Verse 1: Kyle]
So uhm ay, listen bae
Since you’ve been dating your phone all day
Why don’t you come back down to Earth
You spend too much time in cyberspace
Ok, ok, ok this shit’s lame
FaceTime's the only way I get laid
So get off your phone or leave me alone
Yeah, that would be great

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
Baby, do me just one thing
Put that phone down and look at me
I wanna love you but you’d rather tweet
I wanna love you but you’d rather love that screen
Never have I been so green
But how can I be jealous of this scene
I got a man who would never leave
But when he's here, no, he's not with me
[Bridge: Kyle]
Baby girl, you’re bigger than the Instagram
You know that I’m your biggest fan
You're so something to show the pictures can't

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know it's so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know it's so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know its so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know its so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
[Verse 2: Kyle]
So, uhm, I feel like I can see your soul
When I’m with you I feel like I’m 3 years old you know
But the moment you grabbed your phone
It's like I start knocking and no one's home
It's like I start calling and no one's there
I guess if it ain't got likes no one cares
Don’t follow me, walk with me (Damn)
Don’t tweet to me, talk to me (Yeah)
Retweets that don’t mean shit, they say they heart you but not like this
Yeah, you got favorites you ain't they favorite
Oh my bad, did you forget?
All those people on your Facebook page, are not your only friends
I wanna dive into your heart baby, not slide in your dms

[Bridge: Kyle]
Baby girl, you’re bigger than the Instagram
You know that I’m your biggest fan
You're so something to show the pictures can't

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know it's so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know it's so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know its so much bigger babe

King Wavy Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy, cut that down right quick
Ayy attention, attention please
I gotta a message from King Wavy himself
These stank booty niggas copy cat
Hate perpetrate are now underwater
Coming to the ocean, they ain't gonna take our shit
This is our wave, niggas got me hot bro

[Verse 1: KYLE]
Hey Kyle how you doing? Oh yo, I'm good
Yeah doing fine, you know, checking Vine
And wishing bitch niggas would, you know
Same old same, same old flame
Hella change but nothing changed
You a nothing nigga with a nothing squad
And a nothing song that got nothing plays
Californi-motherfucking-ayy I've been up for days
Tryna make sure all my niggas paid every beat gets slayed
Sixteens sweeter than a rich girl birthday
Give your bitch a pool but she still act thirsty
Super-duper-destroyed niggas in the worst way

That's got you feeling all extra tough
You a stunt man and I'm stunting bruh
So who the fuck gets paid more? I do
All the lil niggas from the hood wanna fight you
And if I was a bitch I would act just like you
Go in, go in, nigga I go
How to come weak, huh nigga I don't know
Fire spittin' kid spittin' fire I roast
Quarterback hands lil nigga I throw (Pow pow)

Keep it flowing like I left the bathroom sink on
Can't stop, won't stop, nigga I keep going
Bay to LA anybody get Deebo'ed

Hello, I'm back it's Gerald (Hello)
Come through in all black apparel (That's him!)

Flex on em like, "look what you made me do"
Try stunt on me I stunt on you

Bay area bruh I rep for the coast
Cali's on fire I ain't even tryna boast
Hoes on the side like it's jelly on toast
If she gets too close then I hit her with the dos
Peace ho, got me pissed off
Edward Scissorhands I cut a bitch off
Headed to the top tell a bop get lost
'Cause I'm blowing up out of here, ready, lift off (Yee)

Ups & Downs Lyrics[Intro]
How brave do I become when truly loved?
My overwhelmin' feels are overcome
I might even hit the blunt
And I don't do that for anyone, no
Ooh
I think I'ma dance for the first time in a long time
Ooh
I might even laugh like I mean it
Come on, baby, say it like you mean it
You gonna be alright, baby
Alright, you know you're gonna be fine
You're gonna be alright, baby

[Verse 1]
Hey Kyle, how you doin'?
What is this dream you're pursuin'?
What are these feelings you mention? (What?)
Are you from a different dimension? (Are you?)
My nigga, do you have dementia?
Why is you rappin' 'bout happy?
Think about all the bad shit that happens (Yeah)
You know that inside, you feel crappy
Okay, yup, how did you guess?
Skrrt, I am a wreck
I set a record for bein' upset
Truthfully, honestly, I am a mess
I am depressed, I am obsessed
With self-deprecating and blamin' myself
Socially lyin', denyin' the help
I'm holdin' up like pants missing a belt
But it ain't so bad (No, no)
Look what I be on
I'm on TV, mom
My nigga, I am a phenom
My chick is outta this world (World, what?)
Yeah, badder than Zenon
When I need somebody to lean on
I put that Cudi CD on
In my spare time, punchin' walls, fuckin' up my hand
I know that shit sounds super cray
But if you had this life, you'd understand
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything's a lot o' up and down
But I ain't gonna let it get me down
No (No, no)

[Chorus]
Ups and downs
Ups (No) and downs
Yo, ayy

[Verse 2]
2016 hit me like a bag o' bricks, yup
2017 switched up, like ooh, it's lit (It's lit!)
Yo, I nearly had a mental breakdown
And eight months later, had a hit (Yup)
I guess life is like box a chocolates, huh
You never know what you finna get
Haha, yeah
Think about this 'fore you flip
There's always two sides o' the coin
Come on, man, you gotta keep goin'
You blessed, nigga, you don't even know it
Sittin' there, lookin' all stoic, hmm
Bein' stiff, you should be stoked, hmm
You can smile even if you broke, yo
You can be a Budden or a Boat, true
Yeah, trust me, believe me, I been there too
Down on my luck, I was just like you
Singin' the same damn sad old song
Boo hoo (Yeah, hoo)
But you'll be fine, it'll all be fine
It's just in your mind, yep (Mmm)

Raining Love Lyrics[Intro]
I'm not gonna spit game, send me a pic babe

Whatever you want girl, send me a list babe

For all the heartbreakers and chasers played around with your heart now
And I'mma make these niggas find out
And I'mma brighten up your dark now
'Cause late at night I dream of you oh so
Bad I lose sleep I need you I know so
If it’s all the same your boyfriend is so- so
Why does he complain with a girl that’s so oh whoa!
[Bridge]
And I know you out there looking for love and that’s alright
I hear you telling all of your friends I’m not your type
But let’s be honest girl there’s no point to lie
'Cause it’s raining love and we gon' turn it up for one night

Who do everything better than our exes, right
Two times for the girls with the curls
And an ass like they got down in Texas, 'ight
Had me like "damn," when I seen your face
Made me forget what I had to say
We might as well get a room for a week
'Cause damn girl you done got ass for days
And I don't even drink, I bought the liquor for you
And I don't even fight, I'll hit that nigga for you
Like for really, I'm not the nigga to lie
Like a polygraph, all I know is the truth
And the truth is all that college is useless
'Cause your brain's amazing, but that ass stupid
Me and you could do things, I don't usually do this
I'mma take you higher than my condo roof is
Yeah
[Bridge]
And I know you out there looking for love and that’s alright
I hear you telling all of your friends I’m not your type

Oceans Lyrics[Hook]
Well I'm in Ventura just posted
Got done hitting my old chick
Called up my nigga Nolan
Said lets get this shit in motion
Now I'm really fucking I done upgraded from lotion
Put put on my rubber suit and I'll go diving in the ocean

[Verse 1]
Told her come chill with my brosephs
My circle's really open
Ya’ll know what you like, but I never been the type for smokin'
That's been me since age 13 and holidays with no friends
When Mr. Man had the crib with speakers, they was loc'n
Yes sometimes my game be slacking, but that’s just because I’m focused
I’m giving hugs and making sure that all my verses go in
If you let me hit it, then I swear I’ll Sammy Sosa it
You got perfect legs girl, I wonder what time they open
Yeah, I wonder what time they open
Yo, this bottle of Ciroc is a coupon

Yeah I wanted Pokemon but that don't make me a nerd
And yeah I saved your Facebook pic, but that don't makes me a perv
Does it? Really really I swear
What the fuck do you put in your hair?
Please explain how you get your ass to fit in that chair
And I failed all my college classes, all I could do was just stare
You should let me hit like for real that shit’s only fair
No, I’m dead serious
Take it off, yeah, just take off your pants
Shut up, shut up
Haha, da da da da ahhhh

I’m sorry, but that’s not usually me and all
But the outline of your jeans and all
Make me wanna beat my meat and all
They say love ain't cheap at all
And if it’s real, then keep it all
Bring it to my bedroom baby, I bet we won’t sleep at all
Yeah, but the couch works fine
Your legs and your head and your mouth work fine
Whatever you want but that drink, that’s mine
Nah that ain't grape juice, that’s wine
Nah that ain't real shit that’s around
Nah that ain't, okay well it is
Pictures of you taking a shower and the address to where you live
I mean uh it’s not like I was going to use it
You know, I was not going to kill you and your parents
Or something weird like that

​iSpy (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Kyle]
I ain't been gettin' high...
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me girl, I don't always reply
Well, you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's coming at me, I wonder who throws it
I got tunnel vision and these niggas out of focus
Super Duper Sniper gang, don't get hit with the scope, kid, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This went hella platinum, nigga, it was just a throwaway
My album so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a motherfucking snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah, but I still ain't gonna post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06
I ain't cried since '01, they freed Lil Kodak, the kids back let's throw somethin'
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note
[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes

I could spot you from a hundred miles away, ayy
I can see you through my Jim Maui shades, ayy
When I pull up, I’m in a black Audi A8, ayy
Leave your man ‘cause he ain’t nothin’ like me, babe
I’ve been trying to get out my bubble ‘cause I ain’t never wanting to be linking up
I don’t ever wanna be doing features
I stay far away from these people
Said she love me, but I don’t believe her
Yeah I want you, but I don’t need ya
Even when I ain't lookin’, I see ya
You can’t even see me, but I see ya
I’m just chilling, smokin' reefer
Dropping codeine in a liter
I got more stripes than a Zebra
I’m a Gemini, she’s a Libra
Pulling stunts like Evel Knievel
Once I freak her, I’ma delete her
I was just talking to Auntie Rita
Told her “Stay out here ‘cause we need ya”, ayy, ayy
I ain’t stalking, but I see ya over there, yeah
Yeah I’m watching 'cause this Sniper Gang for real, yeah
Hit the dentist, and I’ll put diamonds in my grill, yeah
Don’t think I'm soft girl, I’m just showing you how I feel
Ayy, yeah yeah yeah, booted up on a pill
Ayy, yeah yeah yeah, can see ya from over here
Ayy, yeah, baby girl, I can see you in a lift
See you riding in a spliff
I put VV’s on your ear, ayy

Fruit snacks and cups of Patron

Bitches be sniffin' that snow
Girlies in reindeer gear
Dancing for silver and gold (Silver and gold, silver and gold)
Yo, yo, fruit snacks and cups of Patron
Don’t really smoke
Bitches be sniffin' that snow
Girlies in reindeer gear
Dancing for silver and gold (Silver and gold, silver and gold)

Deeper Lyrics[Intro]
You would like to see something really sexy?
Misour, you don't, uh, you don't sound so sure?
Well what about your mom?
Oh, no no no, she won't come in just, uh
Turn the music up she won't hear us

[Verse 1]
As long as we're here alone tell me your, tell me your secrets
I won't tell a soul I promise to, promise to keep it
And I'll do things you'll tell all of your friends, friends, friends
Friends have to love me girl, it's only pretend (yeah)
Yeah, cause I know, yeah I know how bad
You wanna get it off your chest
Yeah, and I know, yeah I know how bad
You want it to make sense
[Chorus: Kyle & Beldina]
Girl, my mom isn't home again
Locked all the doors and I, turned off the phone again
Turn off the lights I'll do, you in the morn' again
Crawl in my bed and I'll, show you how warm it is, yeah
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Okay, well woah, take a load off
Let me hold your worries baby, help you take your coat off
And if you're thirsty baby you can have a soda
Or some shots, I mean fuck it, why not? You know?
I know you brought the cuffs and all because your dad's a cop
But I'd rather not, cause there'd be no way to make you stop
We can swap, cause you know I'm down to give the tippy top
Okay wait, alright wait, oh okay, there's the spot

[Chorus: Kyle & Beldina]
Girl, my mom isn't home again
Locked all the doors and I, turned off the phone again
Turn off the lights I'll do, you in the morn' again
Crawl in my bed and I'll, show you how warm it is, yeah
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
My mom isn't home again
Locked all the doors and I, turned off the phone again
Turn off the lights I'll do, you in the morn' again
Crawl in my bed and I'll, show you how warm it is, yeah
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper18Embed

FUN Lyrics[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Saying ain't nobody can stop me, they better sit back and watch me, for really though
These niggas is silly though, they think that I'm floppy
No this isn't Kinko, you cannot make copies
And just 'cause you're a dick, gives you no right to be cocky
Feelin' like I'm holy though, flowin' like it's snowin'
Me and 4, 5 of the homies, girls acting like they know me 'cause my Rollie though
Well this is just the life of knowing you the shit
And I don't think I'm ever finna quit, nah

[Hook]
Party at my place, we gon' be faded, it's gon' be fun

[Verse 2]
Well this is over fuckin' weirdo, the game had zero
Makin' white money I call it that Rob De Niro
Young cuz known to make your buzz disappear-o
One diss song will drop your followers to zero, ugh!
Ayo doggy duder, did you really think
That you could do-do-do-do anything as good as me?
You need a shrink, yo', think you're good as me? No
If you really think so, you must really think slow
'Cause you're not
See, girls is on my jock 'round the clock, 'cause I'm probably hot
I could make a fucking country song and it'll probably bop
Ayo Taylor, I'd really love to nail her
I could rock the boat if she'd let me be her sailor
Aw jeez, it’s that leather Chuck T, shark teeth
Havin' nappy ass nigga from the V with my team, uh
This is just a life of knowing that you're real
So I ain't got shit to do but chill
Yeah

[Hook]
Party at my place, we gon' be faded, it's gon' be fun

[Intro]
(So what's this Kyle?)
Hmm? Oh, this is just a break up song
(What happened, Kyle?)
It's sad, bro
Umm, I don't know, you know what i'm sayin'?
Me and my- me and my boo thang
We was going through some things at one point in time
And, and I don't know I wrote this song
I think I was-
I think I was sippin' on something
And this shit just poured out
It's kinda tight though
It's like I'm-
(It's like I'm, it's like I'm, it's like I'm)

[Hook]
You can search all you like
You will never find
Someone just like me, ooh
Me, ooh
So have fun, cause I won't
No I won't, no I won't
So have fun 'cause I won't
No I won't, no I won't
You can have fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
You can have fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
Hope you have some fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
Guess I wasn't fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
Those other guys are fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
You can have fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
'Cause all you want is fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
Stupid fucking fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
