My Beyoncé Lyrics[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Ooh, I like the way she move
Shorty my baby, my everything, she the truth
Together we cool, me and her can't lose
Keep 'em on their feet, baby, I know they so confused
Shorty my Beyoncé
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ

Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
My Beyoncé

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Trippin' on that drank, but I know she worth it
Independent baby, I know she workin'
Adriana's serving drinks, 20 bottles, urgent
I know it can be better but nobody's perfect
We flirted for a minute, DeJ, that's my baby
I ain't trippin', I'm like Henny, yeah I'm in her kidneys
She like to play her songs to the way I'm hittin' it
Turn around like, "Damn Durk, I like the way you hittin' it"
Don't believe the rumors, girl
You know I'll do you, girl
I don't wanna hear the shit about the niggas
That tried to do you, girl
Fuck the past right now
Shawty got you right now
And you hot right now
You can get it right now, baby
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Ooh, I like the way she move
Shorty my baby, my everything, she the truth
Together we cool, me and her can't lose
Keep 'em on their feet, baby, I know they so confused

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
I let him get it when he want it, knock it down and push up on it
I was plottin' for a while, now I got him where I want him
They didn't understand none of this was planned
99 problems but a bitch better not be none
Na na, na na, yeah yeah
This ain't what he want, I told him that
Leave your girl, be through with that
Get with DeJ, he ain't ever goin' back
He was shy when I seen him, now he smile
Heard a few rumors but they ain't my style
I be hatin' when he out of town
Hotel, I FaceTime you, no towel
They ain't get it but they ain't our problem
What the fuck can they do about it?
Durk and DeJ
I'm thinkin' 'bout changin' my last name
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Ooh, I like the way she move
Shorty my baby, my everything, she the truth
Together we cool, me and her can't lose
Keep 'em on their feet, baby, I know they so confused
Shorty my Beyoncé
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
Shorty my Beyoncé
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
My Beyoncé

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
You and I
White dress, flowers, and a suit and tie
Me and you like Bonnie and Clyde
No beat the case, we're do or die
Who am I to say you ain't natural?
Your haters my haters, ain't switchin' up, baby, I got you
I'm with her like a tattoo
The way you wear that dress, they gon' attack you
The way you look at me, baby, I got you
I hit it from the front, I like the back too
She say, "Lay down so I can ride you"
I know that she fiending
She scratchin' my back, I like how she screamin'
I fuck her and leave her, she fiending
Shawty my Beyoncé

3 Headed Goat Lyrics[Intro]
(Aviator)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
I can't keep takin' these pills, when I'm in the trenches, they say I be cappin' a lot
I know a nigga who say he got rich off the dope, but I know he be actin' a lot
I know some niggas who said that they took down the city, but niggas be lackin' a lot
Yeah
That shit was awful, nigga had that dog food
That day they shot you, I slid on a Mongoose
You cannot come back around me, you turned your back on me, I cannot forget
The police was lyin', they say that they caught you, but nigga, they made you admit
Your name was found, you put in that work, they took your stick, you a bitch
Fuck my opps, they be on my dick, they all be mad we rich (Turn up)
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Only twenty-five, livin' like a boss, ridin' 'round with a chauffeur
I don't sell drugs, still be paranoid, keep lookin' over my shoulder
Niggas lyin' like I'm stealin' swag, boy, that's my shit like I wrote it

[Verse 3: Polo G]
Uh
These rappers really nice as hell
I'm a different nigga when I'm pissed off
Man, he say he gon' press up on who?
I'ma get the steel like I'm Chris Paul
Back to back suburbans, I'm a big dawg
I was in the slums servin' Fentanyl
Zombieland, junkies havin' withdrawals
I been gettin' to it, lotta missed calls
Turn it off, what the fuck is he talking 'bout?
I should slap you for sayin' he hot as me
I don't know who could fuck with me honestly
They know I'm the man, so they watchin' me
Different color bands like Monopoly
Man, he must not be usin' his head
If he thinkin' I don't keep a Glock with me
That's like suicide if you play with us
Got a better chance at the lottery
Call an ambulance when that chopper sweep
Make the crowd dance, choreography
Once I got a plan, ain't no stoppin' me
Three-car garage, million-dollar crib
With a foreign bitch ridin' on top of me
Lot of people done said I wouldn't be shit
Well, I guess they owe me an apology
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key37Embed

I got cash and they mad, I pull up in that Jag'
My shoe red, your boo mad 'cause I'm shitting on they ass
I got cash, I pop tags, rob me, pop your ass
I stay flee, I'm the man, video on demand
Stripper bitches, fat ass, fire face, you that mad
Smoking dope that gas, savager hammertime
Calling up Jason Nine, STR8 down the drive
Thick bitches down to ride, that's why they mad at me
Ten dicks to meet the president now
Gotta do the whole squad to be the shit now
I got a deal, thinking I'm the shit now
I'll never change, never wife a bitch now

[Chorus]
You wanna meet the president? You gotta meet the bang bros
Hella bank rolls, all them bank rolls ain't yours
Spending, flexing, so much cash that it can't fold
Up and coming rappers, man, I don't see those
Boy, all that cuffing you should be a P.O
So much designer shit that I can give away clothes
All these new niggas, all that shit rapping is old
To meet the president, you gotta meet the bang bros
[Verse 2]
Hold up, they know we shit like sure enough
Can't sleep on us like pour up
Hole in them just like donuts, we go nuts
D-Thang shares thots, SB shares thots, Chino shares thots
But I can't wife a thot
See it's levels to this shit
She fuck the bang bros and you married to this bitch
A salad, I got all types of carats on my wrist
One night, I don't need a lot of shit
These bitches is crazy, these bitches amaze me
These niggas don't phase me, money and the streets raised me
The industry crazy, just a problem
I'm a young nigga, I'm just chasing me some dollars

[Chorus]
You wanna meet the president? You gotta meet the bang bros
Hella bank rolls, all them bank rolls ain't yours
Spending, flexing, so much cash that it can't fold

So much designer shit that I can give away clothes

Broadway Girls Lyrics[Intro: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
2 AM at a Broadway bar
She's puttin’ her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, "You don't have to join in," she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone)
Leave them Broadway girls alone

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
They town just told me, "Don't trust 'em"
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
[Bridge: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, think I oughta settle down
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
But I told 'em that I'm savage
They just tryna tell me there's

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
There's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Leave them Broadway girls alone

You had me soft I couldn't function it
Only gave me pussy, wasn't suckin' it

Yea, I know imma dog that shit ain't fair
Thought I'll be mad I don't even care
Now I put my new bitch on the Lear
Diamonds in the air like chandeliers
If she around then I'm aware
You say ''only him,'' you lyin' again
Bluetooth in the coupe you need to pair
That hoe shit was in the air
If your friends a ho then you's a ho
Wherever you go I know they go
Don't follow your dream you follow bankrolls
Yo ass so fake thought you was ten toes

Tell me what's it gonna be, if dis ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, so, dis ain't what you want
I'm on the road, doin' shows, so wealthy, dis ain't what you want
Hit the road, you can go, I know, dis ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me, but dis ain't what you want (Dis ain't what you want)
And I guarantee, dis ain't what you want
I'm from the land, where ain't no lackin' at, dis ain't what you want
I wrap 'em up, we get it done 'cause dis ain't what you want (L's)
[Verse 1]
Niggas claim that they're after me, but dis ain't what they want
'Cause I hopped into this industry, dis ain't what they want
See this rap shit ain't shit to me, dis ain't what they want
I got the police all into me, dis ain't what they want
In my own city they hate on me, put weight on me
Fuck TMZ, fuck breaking news and ABC
I can't do no shows 'cause I terrify my city
They say I terrify my city
Niggas gettin' slumped, we the first to get blamed
A nigga try us, he the first one to get changed
They say he snitch, tryna put dirt on my name
They ride on me, ask is Lil Durk my name (L's)

[Chorus]
Tell me what's it gonna be, if dis ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, so, dis ain't what you want
I'm on the road, doin' shows, so wealthy, dis ain't what you want
Hit the road, you can go, I know, dis ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me, but dis ain't what you want
And I guarantee, dis ain't what you want

Daddy doin' life, snitches doin' months
I'm screamin' free the real 'cause dis ain't what you want
A nigga claim 300, add a K, you done
I'm really in the field 'cause this is what I want (This what I want)
I'ma turn the streets up, this is a anthem
Niggas hate on my squad, I tell 'em step the shit up (L, Ls)
Same since day one and I can't change up
After all of the gossip, I'll still a-change some
Fuck-niggas don't want none (Niggas don't want it)
They don't want it
Same niggas since day one (Day one)
Nigga, I'm 3Hunna (L, L's)
[Chorus]
Tell me what's it gonna be, if dis ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, so, dis ain't what you want
I'm on the road, doin' shows, so wealthy, dis ain't what you want
Hit the road, you can go, I know, dis ain't what you want

Make It Out Lyrics[Intro]
But if I call you my brother that mean you my brother, you know what I'm sayin'?
Nothin' more, nothin' less, family
I been hearing too many rumors in these streets niggas tryin' kill us, rob us all that
What's up with that?
But it be the niggas that been around us, you know what I'm sayin'?
Or be around us
We ain't gon' slip up, we ten toes
Remy
You know what I'm sayin' we gotta make it out
That's how they gon' get it

[Chorus]
I get so high I put these drugs into my system
I love you with all my heart, ain't no probably
You choose your life over your son, that shit killed him
I never asked you for anything, just your honesty
How you trade on me like that? I'm your family
And she tried to chase a bag before I had to leave
But two wrongs don't make it right
Get with your dog and make it right
[Verse 1]
We do pop-ups, had my back when I was locked up
I was Glocked up
Niggas hate 'cause they can't stop us (No no)
We was turnt up, gang war can't knock us
Sliding in them DMs, tryna slide up on the oppas, yeah
I'm so nauseous off them drugs, too high off them percocets
Tryna follow behind my cousin, I wasn't focused yet
We would rob the robbers, kill the killers, label us a threat
Extort your big homie, like we from LAX
I was so high, I wish I replied to L'A's text
But we had jumped into them streets and made a mess
I was dressing my homies up for they funerals
Holding on they OGs tight, they did the most
Ducking from investigation, trying to keep my reputation
Give them my expiration, looking for inspiration
Pray for my generation, fuck Trump, them bitches racist
Bought 'Raris just to race it, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I get so high I put these drugs into my system
I love you with all my heart, ain't no probably
You choose your life over your son, that shit killed him
I never asked you for anything, just your honesty
How you trade on me like that? I'm your family
And she tried to chase a bag before I had to leave
But two wrongs don't make it right
Get with your dog and make it right
[Verse 2]
Joke and laugh all day to stop from crying
Keep my gun on me to stop from dyin'
Can't listen to no rumors 'cause it block my mind
Can't feed into that bullshit ain't got the time
I know what I did boy, this life I enjoy
Why you pretend boy, this shit I live for it (Uh huh)
You was hooked on drugs, I was hooked on phonics
Signed to the street,s I ain't never go to college
Asked you for cash, you ain't never say you got it (Damn)
But I gave you my last, yeah
And I'm the same nigga since last year
I told my momma I can't go down for this case
Got the same lawyer, beat R. Kelly piss case
State's attorney want me so bad
At the time I need you bad
Told myself ain't going back
Told myself can't go like that

[Chorus]
I get so high I put these drugs into my system
I love you with all my heart, ain't no probably
You choose your life over your son, that shit killed him
I never asked you for anything, just your honesty
How you trade on me like that? I'm your family
And she tried to chase a bag before I had to leave
But two wrongs don't make it right
Get with your dog and make it right8Embed

Let's get it
Eh ohh

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She don't know about real niggas, she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding 'round and spending it like this (Now she wanna fuck)
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Have you ever met a Chi-Town nigga?
Girl I heard you need a go-getter
You ain't never meet a rapper with the swag of a savage and a dope dealer
I'm the realest nigga that you see
I know you tired of them broke niggas
Heard he bought you a bag for a G
Why you fuckin' with them broke niggas?
Ginger ale and a fifth of liquor
Where you going, girl? I'm going with ya
Ride with me 'cause I'm number one
Two bitches, Malcolm in the middle
Fly to Vegas, bet life
Legs in the air, call it "jet life"
Shawty give me top with the neck like
Shit gave me life, I can't get right, I can't get right

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Got you jacuzzi water on a hundred
Got your tempo on a hundred, let it bubble up (Bubble up, bubble up, bub)
Need a bad bitch, tryna be a bad girl
You know I'm tryna trouble up (You know, I'm tryna trouble up, shawty)
Buy everything she wants two times, baby, double up (Know you really want it)
Say she need more niggas out here like me 'cause there's not enough (Not enough, not enough, no, no)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She don't know about real niggas, she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding 'round and spending it like this (Now she wanna fuck)
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me
Do drugs with a nigga like me
Fall in love with a nigga like me
And never love another nigga, never love another nigga like me
(Me, me)
[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
You ain't never been in my town, nigga
A good place to go but the murder rate's so ridiculous
Fell in love with some R&B bitch
And I know that it's good for the fame and for the image
Shawty gave me head like a penny
But she should go gold
Ain't really been in love in a minute
It won't hurt if no one know 'bout me
Fuck a bag off
No makeup, you look better with your mask off
Rich nigga wanna buzz, like to brag y'all
But a nigga like me, ain't no nigga like me
I'm a Boss, Hugo
Rich nigga since birth, you know
You my bitch don't get mad, Cujo
Nigga like me, I'm that nigga, nigga
Gettin' money since a little nigga
Shawty thinks she the shit, but she could be a lil' thicker
Fuck on my name and a little liquor
I got 'em pissed, I'm the shit, nigga
So why do they hate? I gotta get cake
These niggas so fake
So stay out my way (My way)
Ain't too many niggas like me
[Chorus: Jeremih]
She don't know about real niggas (Yeah), she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding 'round and spending it like this (Now she wanna fuck)
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me

Get head from my groupie bitch
You wifin' hoes, you losin' it

Dede on his savage shit, you know that boy be wildin' out
You know I bring savage out

Bro'nem gotta be bonding out

Wifin, we don't do that shit, that shit be trifling
'Cause the same bitch that eat the clit, like she dyking

She sucking dick, that's same bitch you give goodnight kiss
Sucka, yo ass a sucka, Superman

I put diamonds on your hand, now hold your fist up (Fist up)
How I know if I get jammed, you gon' keep it real?
How you gon' say that I ain't solid? I ain't never squealed
If I die today, give it to my son, ain't writin' no will
All these thoughts inside my head, it got me poppin' pills

And you can't say you super trill, 'cause you ain't cut right
Sex her once, then kick her out 'cause I don't nut twice (Nut twice)
The way that A$AP died don't sit in my gut right
And if we ever find the killer, then he must die (Must die)
And I'm always low on niggas, I don't trust high
I don't know if you gon' ride, don't know if you gon' slide
Don't know want me to die, don't know if it's your pride
And if it is, then hide it then (Hide it then)

All Love Lyrics[Intro]
(TouchofTrent be wildin' with it)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
They told me it's all love, but I love all
I'm Cash App-in' a couple hundred whenever my brother call
Sometimes I like to scandalize, feel like I'm above 'em all
It was a joke when he copped out, now he wanna jump the wall
Them niggas always with some goofies, gettin' jumped at malls
I was tired of fuckin', it was one more condom, I made the condom fall
From Stall & Dean jacket, that shit turned to Gucci scarf
Like fuck the whole world no matter who involved

[Chorus: Booka600]
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Man, it's all love
You can't love me without my brother 'cause it's all us
I'm off a Perc', my brother Doodie, he off a small bus
But I'm a baller, when I pass the ball, I yell, "Hut"
Gotta watch them cheesy, sneaky bitches, they be stealin' nut
I talk down on the trenches' hoes, knowin' damn well I still fucked
But the money keep me insane, and I ain't know what a homie was
I was fucked up in the trenches, I ain't even know what a Rollie was
I used to look up to this nigga, but he gave his homie up
'Cause his daughter twelve years old, he gotta go do twenty-one
And I don't fuck with no fuck niggas, so these niggas don't owe me nothin'
Grown niggas act like kids, actin' like they Benjamin Button
Put my own fee down for my lawyer, that shit was twenty-one hundred
Had a deep talk with my dawg and he still wasn't comin'
With a gun or without his gun, I say he still not runnin'
And he tote his gun like 50, but he still one hundred, nigga

[Chorus: Booka600]
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
It's all love, I thought it was real
He took a Percocet, wasn't all tryna pop a pill
Tryna prove a point to pop off first, he ain't your dawg for real
I gotta acknowledge that Lam' truck 'cause I had a Bonneville
I don't get mad when the guys tell me no 'cause I know my mama will
Different niggas, they rockin' Polo, I'm rockin' Tommy Hil'
Trenches niggas, they'll drop it all when it's time to kill
First time was a throw off on my backgrounds when I signed a deal
They say it's favoritism, nah, these the ones I love the most
I bought her two, three diamond chokers 'cause she love to choke
1942 with a small pill, she love the boat
Durkio, Smurkio, yeah, she love the G.O.A.T.
Yeah, I love them G locks
Got away from all them phony niggas, I had to detox
They don't even shoot at niggas no more, they love to beatbox
Walked up out your life with a pair of socks
That's two hundred, that's them G socks
[Chorus: Booka600]
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk & Pooh Shiesty]
Throw that mask on, when you jump out first, you better blast (Yeah)
V. don't like slow shit, on hits them switches (Frrt) fast (Gang)
Ain't gon' lie, the city hot with strikers, they don't last (Turn up)
When you pop in with your killers, you better check your gas (Man, what?)
We don't party on other blocks, they fuck with other opps (Let's get it)
Then come 'round like you gang, that got your brother shot (Brrah)
You say his name insidе a song, that got your brother hot (Let's get it)
Thеn leave him hangin' without a lawyer, that shit dumb as fuck (Pussy)
You come outside without your gun, lil' boy, you dumb as fuck (Dumb as fuck)
Ain't no quick run to the store, they pop out, fire you up (Brrah)
I told my P.O. through the gate that I get high as fuck (I get high as fuck)
She ask me how high do I get? I told her high as Duck (Tooka)
My brother told me get some property, I kept gettin' Glockies (Gettin' Glocks)
I told him, "I only drink Wocky," he say I'm gettin' cocky (Let's get it)
All them bitches wanna fuck me, I don't give them money
One bitch thought I told her, "Yeah," I said, "You better block me"
He survived one to the head, but it fucked up his body
You think he off an eight of red the way that nigga noddin'
He don't even know 'bout drugs, he say, "Lean, OxyContin"
You tryna judge him off his looks, that lil' boy actually robbin'
Man, he talkin' 'bout gang in this bitch (Why he callin', talkin' 'bout gang?)
He ain't get back from that one shit, man, his gang ain't on shit (Still ain't get back for no gang)
Foenem posted up outside (Shit), Dracos hangin' and shit (King Drac', I let it hang)
Before he died, his ass a goofy, now he famous as shit (Blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd)
[Verse 2: Pooh Shiesty]
I'm King Draco, got my name off drillin', check the record, bitch (Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt)

Send off a bag 'bout my lil' cousin, they fakin', they'll call it quit (Woah, woah)
They make me mad enough, I spin through there myself, say the wrong shit (Say the wrong shit)
Might still sip when I get low (Woah), but I prefer Wock' over Tris (Wocky over Tris)
Fucked up and let me in the door (Woah), I went fully on all the sticks (Sticks)
I'm Mr.-Slime-'Em-Out (Blrrrd), I caught his back door, unlocked on a lick (Blrrrd)
Or Mr.-Leave-No-Evidence (Blrrrd), know my criminal book hella thick (On God)
You niggas goose, ain't got no gun, you went away, your ass a dummy
I'm on my sixth Moncler this winter, I couldn't wait to get some money
My lil' nigga up four souls, he caught two dressed up like a junkie
They thought I was just rappin' (Blrrrd), lay that murder gang, that shit ain't funny (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
You lay, the murder gang, they come through, that shit ain't funny (Uh, blrrrd)
I'm locked in with hunters, from the God, got killers 'round the country (Uh, blrrrd, blrrrd)
I might don't need to slime 'em out, just be yourself and stay three hunnid (Hunnid)
We get money Monday through Saturday, pray to Trey Day every Sunday (Trey Day every)
My clique tied up in the field (Blrrrd), won't never hear me go out runnin' (Nope)
Post up a pic like I'm in L.A., but the whole time I'm with gun (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Ain't tryna keep hearin' 'bout that shit you did, go get active again (The whole time)
It's either eat or get ate on my side, I'ma fuck the drops and go and spin (Spin)
Three and O, we skunkin' shit, get one more kill, conceal the win (Win)
Beef with us, won't never land 'til y'all get hit up with them pens (Pens)
Can't come around unless you get a body, chopper, F&N (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
We caught one of them pussies drunk, he died before he dropped the Henn' (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Got 'bout ten whips in my garage and still don't know what to get in (Take off)
Take off the emblems out the 'Cat, tint out the window 'fore I spin (Shh, blrrrd)

Thats why I gotta ride through all the opp shit

Bitch ain't send me money, I had to face it
And since my car white they'll swear I'm racist
She say she freak nasty so I'm on that shit
Niggas snitching here, he'll get his face lift
Bitch I'm from Chicago where we go ape shit
If we catch a hommie we don't say shit
Even rappers know we ain't who to play with
I can't wife a eater, I just freak her
Pass her to my niggas like a blunt of reefer
30 don’t jam it's like aquafina
Free my nigga Jam that lil boy a demon
And since I got my deal, I feel important
I live what I rap and just record it
They tried to give me 10 if I didn't have a lawyer
Niggas out here snitching, they're straight informers
Try Me! Try Me!
Bullets got his name on it like a ID
Sipping on the lean is like my IV
My crazy life, I feel like YG

Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body

They really don't mean it, he say it in songs (Yeah, mean it, say it, songs)
They really don't mean it, he play it in songs (Pussy, bitch, bitch, yeah)
[Verse 2]
He talking 'bout me in "Pissed Me Off"? And I'm like, "Yes" (Yes)
If you feel some type of way, you better slide and get revenge (Brrah)
He say, "Therapy ain't helping," he been killing for a cleanse (Slide)
She said she ain't really got shit but she so thirsty for a Benz (Skrrt, skrrt)
I just made her suck my dick and I just nutted on her chin (Bitch)
I been feeling like Rico, I just fucked her in my Timbs (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
For school, he save no pen, he'd rather carry him a gen (Five)
A ten (Ten), FN ('N), Perc' 10, I'm saying, he spinning (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You need a pill to slide, he off all 'em milligrams, he been a fan (Bitch)
I seen niggas really killing shit, post shit on Instagram (Pussy)
You doing that, you might as well go to court and say you killed the man
I don't claim niggas who be with opps, I try to reel 'em in (Grrah)
The trenches like a sport, you grab that ball and turn a killer, man (Pussy)
Switches on me, all faceshots, we changing dental plans (Brrah)
All fast cars, make it skrrt, we don't do rental vans (Skrrt)
I can have your homie set you up, his ass a middleman (Ah, ha)

[Chorus]
Don't respond to shit with Von (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm like, fuck it, you tripping, go get your gun (Let's get it, yeah, gun)
They dropping locations, I'm getting it done (Woo, woo, woo, gang)
Fuck tweeting, we sliding, the feds will come (Yeah, yeah, yeah, man, what?)
He fucking his bitches (Bitches), them niggas (Niggas) his sons (Let's get it)
I'm hanging with killers, we breaking a bond (Yeah, yeah, yeah, bond)
They really don't mean it, he say it in songs (Yeah, mean it, say it in songs)
They really don't mean it, he play it in songs (Bitch, yeah)

Internet Sensation Lyrics[Intro]
(Carl Paul)

[Verse 1]
This is how I feel, I got your love attached to me
And you know I truly love you, it was never about no pussy
And you told me that them niggas ain't for me, they just want my money
And I like the way you is, you ain't tryna kick it with my buddies
And I got a habit and I like that you don't judge me
And that's so fucked up that I'm glad to be a junkie
To fall in love, I say I been afraid
I'm mixin' lean with Lyrical Lemonade
And we on top, ain't no more public aid
Or callin' your boss to get another raise
I drop some Backwood ashes in the Wraith
Reminiscing 'bout the older days
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the people don't let the 'net ruin they relationship
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the females who won't listen to another bitch
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the niggas in the trenches turned to gentlemen
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta tell the truth, this the best relationship I ever been in

[Verse 2]
Whoever thought that I can make this shit?
Voice of the streets and relationship
And we don't care what the rumor is
Fuck these other hoes 'cause I love my bitch
Alexander McQueen and Rockstar jeans
The prosecutor hatin' 'cause I'm doin' my thing
Six kids plus her daughter, that's what it is (Oh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
I seen Rel fall in love, I know that shit crazy
I seen Booka fall in love, I know that shit crazy
Inside, and don't let the outside run that situation
And it's me and her forever, it's a lit-uation, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the people don't let the 'net ruin they relationship
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the females who won't listen to another bitch
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the niggas in the trenches turned to gentlemen
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta tell the truth, this the best relationship I ever been in5Embed
