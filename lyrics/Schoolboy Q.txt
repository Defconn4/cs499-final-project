Collard Greens Lyrics[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh,  uh
Yo, yo

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with the shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver
Watch this, no tick, yeah I'm the nigga
Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver
Faded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer
Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiendin'
Give me, give me, give me some
Freak the freckles off your face
Frenchy, freakin', swappin' tongue
Click my link and spread your buns
Lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it, baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Fuckin' in the car service, thank me for the car pool
Chromosome, part full, probly off a Norco
And gas, not the Arco, poppin' since the intro
You shoppin' from the window, play my favorite tempo
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Hold up, biatch! This yo' favorite song
Translation: Ven aquí, mami, ese culo
Tu quieres coger mis huevos, y papi me desespero
Chuparse puto pendejo, el pinche cabron
Let's get it – nights like this, I'm a knight like this
Sword in my hand, I fight like this
And I'm more than a man, I'm a god
Bitch, touché, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop
Out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo-doo-doo-doo," bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this
I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, on forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down
Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Bummy nigga famous, straight from the bottom
Broke niggas hate it, still never robbed him
Guns in the basement, out they have a problem
Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana
Function on fire, burn the roof off this mothafucka
Psych ward is ballin', go craze like no other
Weed steady blowin', pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'
Faded, faded, faded, right?
Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no, it's not the Westside
Stick it up your SoutHside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year
I spend that on my daughter shoes
Smokin' weed and drinkin', all the college students lovin' Q
We gon' turn it out until the neighbors wanna party too
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit840Embed

See this Top Dawg in heat, but I'ma fuck the world

You sat me down, I'm still tryna get higher
You looked at me stupid when I twisted the fire
Meanwhile my nigga drunk as fuck
A nigga fucked up, we all fucked up
You done fucked up, I brought more blunts
Smoke back to up, you niggas know what's up

Blessed Lyrics[Intro]
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

[Verse 1]
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say
[Chorus]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Verse 2]
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like "It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight"
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
"Fuck police" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son
[Chorus]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

THat Part (Black Hippy Remix) Lyrics[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Me no conversate with the fake—that part
All my bitches independent bitches—that part
I just want the paper—that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part, ayy

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
It's impossible to love it, if you don't come from it
It's things that goes on, you just can't stomach
I seen it all happen, but I ain't sayin' nada
Peep, 24/7 in the hood it's hot
If you wanna fall through, get Top on the phone
He don't pick up then it ain't bool
Let you know it ain't good to stop
That part, that part (That part)
I'm a Watts nigga and we not kosher
Shit, niggas only concern is the bottom line like a stockholder
This is where they come, where they cop them boulders
Hoes catfight with their tits exposed
Still sippin' on that Wild Irish Rose
Still rock swap-meet designer clothes, ah!
Black MAC 11 in my mattress (Woo!)
Make a hundred racks do a backflip (Woo!)
Might go Uncle Luke on them hoes (Ho!)
Pussy pop for a bankroll (Yeah)
All my killers with me got a blank face (Yeah)
On that "Fuck you, bitch, where the pay pay?"
Make 'em pull up on your block with them 223s
Aim it at your face, hey
Movin' with the rock and the Glock concealers
You either sellin' rock or you flock to get it
You either on the watch or the clock is tickin'
The life of my Watts and my Bompton niggas
Get pinched, I'ma post a bond
Know P.O.P. gon' hold it down, look
Need cash, gotta get you some
If a hater tell you money ain't everything
He don't want you to get none
So we thuggin' like DMX, bleed shit, PMS
Point blank, period, meet me on the ES
I'm fully with the BS, believe that!
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And we don't stress
A .38 'til it free your chest
Then PP on the PO's desk
I'm JAY-Z in a blowout press
Relate me to your blowout's best
Can't hate me, I'm remote you're deaf
I'm HD, causin' photo theft
My AC antifreeze gotta—that part
Hold your breath, I'm 8 feet when I hold this TEC
Protect me from the local threats
My ID say my eye don't rest
My IV qualify T-Rex
Society kept my IQ vexed
Denyin' me from an Ivy school
Applyin' me to the street I slept
I quietly had to hold this tool
Reminding me of the block I repped
The turf I stepped, the church and the earth I blessed
The first I guessed the alert was the murk I chef
That hearse the flirt with perks of a kill confessed
Dispersed the worst, the first 48 addressed
The search of laws and verse of the birth I nest
The—uh, the awe, the curse of a pose in zest
The good, the flaws, the pain to reverse what's left, uh
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Me no conversate with the fake—(Hahaha)—that part
All my bitches independent bitches—that part
I just want the paper—that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part, ayy

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Zest god, zest god, zest god, zest god
Yamborghini high, cream soda with the Wockhardt
Soulo Ho3 the prophet, yeah, Soulo hold the profit
That's the fortune teller makin' withdrawals and deposits
Ironic, they wanna know where I've been in
Where the fuck I've been hidin' in
When the fuck am I droppin' that
New work that take 'em to church and
Turn the universe upside down again
Since you're so smart
I can't get in my groove 'til we get the Q first
Do what thou will not
Yo, my pool of thought large enough to part the Red Sea
Father forgive 'em for they know not know who they see
I got all eyes on me, call me 3Pac

[Interlude: ScHoolboy Q]
Hang on, nigga, let me get some
Hang on, nigga

Gettin' money on a vacay (Hey)
Go go gadget's in the driveway (Driveway)
Groovy Tony in July 8th
Yeah, I'm killin' kitties on a Sunday (Ayy)
How you ballin' in a Hyundai?
My Ferrari got a toupee
Swerve in the big body
Your favorite artist, I'm his big homie
Yeah I'm walkin' with a fifth
And I ain't votin', I'm a Crip, homie (Yeah)
I'm where them Bloods, where them Locs at (Locs at)
Where the blood, where the choke round
Gloves for the combat (Combat)
How the feds in your contacts?
How the feds know my set name?
Fled in the Mulsanne (Ayy)
Hydrate up the rap game
Heard Soulo comin' up next
And SZA got a classic, nigga
Heard Zay just got it mastered, uh
The fire burnin' through the plastic
So fingers to the badges (badges)
They don't love you 'til the racks evolve
When I was broke they wouldn't accept the call
Now they on me for my decimals
Blank Face has gotta X 'em off
Enemies gotta bob and weave
Gangbangin' like we stand for somethin'
When Alton Sterling gettin' killed for nothin'
Two cowards in the car, they're just there to film
Sayin' #BlackLivesMatter, should've died with him
Wrong nigga in your hood, you gon' ride on him
White nigga with a badge, you gon' let that slide?
Tell me how they sent that footage off and slept that night
I feel bad that my daughter gotta live this life
I'll die for my daughter, gotta fight this fight
Put a Blank Face on, nigga, let that drop
That—that part107Embed

Since a youngin, I wanted to ball, nigga
Had a pistol in my drawers, nigga
When I was broke, I had the sauce, nigga
Got a Chevy with side to side on it
Hundred spokes, the Dana Danes on it
Got a chopper that stand at 5'2"
I put your homies right down beside you, uh

Break the Bank Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fuck rap, I've been rich, crack by my stick shift
Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
"Get Mine" my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines, drive-bys at bedtime
Get down, I heard mom, someone lost they grandson
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

[Chorus]
So now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do

La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank
[Verse 2]
My time to show out, finally the illest Crip
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rat
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch, I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel
Good grades and skipped school, this life gon' catch up soon
Sure 'nough that shit did, twenty-year-old kid
Got off my behind, write me some sweet lines
Cause one day my story gon' pay

[Chorus]
So now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like

[Interlude]
Your bitch wanted cash, get her, know I'm around, boy
Tell Kendrick, move from the throne, I came for it
I hope this fuckin' hit arrange for it, cause goddamn

[Refrain]
What you talkin' 'bout if it ain't 'bout the money?
Neck full of gold, I'm attracted to the honey
Rain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money
On Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy

[Verse 3]
Fuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills
Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal
Love how I'm doin', long way from grooving
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day
I let y'all fucks parler, you wonder why I'm straight
New shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row
Bow down her temple, I don't know her info
Threw up my peace sign, go rare with my mignon
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

[Chorus]
So now we 'bout to break the bank

WHat THey Want Lyrics[Produced by Mike WiLL Made It]
[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Might pull up in my bucket
This nine holds a good dozen
Might slide up in your cousin
Just made a mil' and still thuggin'
Niggas banged on me but they should've shot me
See, I hit the corner then spot him, got him
Court date, but I skipped the bail
Rather wig myself before I sit in jail
Need a gang of weed and a pint of lean
Got a hat say Figg' on my gangsta tip
Don't trust no ho, I might sock the bitch
I'm apocalypse to your politics
Might cop the Phantom, get ghost
I can pay your bills with this coat
Need an extra band for this smoke
I can see for miles with this scope, nigga
Got an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer
Misses Piggy, want a piggyback
Rock cremation, then called it crack
I'mma keep on eating 'til my ankles fat
Sell that fix, throw it cross the map
Push my penis in between her lap
Put my semen all down her throat
'Til Tito kilos come off that boat
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G
This the shit they gon' buy
This the shit why I'm fly
This the shit why I'm high
This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want

[Post-Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em

This the shit that they need
This the shit that's from me
This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow
Speeding through the yellow lights
Treat my Versace belt like it's a mistletoe
I put everything over yellow rice
Graduated from hella ice
If I stand on my bankroll (stand on your bankroll)
Nigga, I'd be scared of heights
And I'd be dodging the po-lice
When I was poor with no lights
When I was poor with potential
Watch my flow in four inches
Oh Lord, she in Christians
All gold for my Adventist
Pulled it down and she kissed it
All gold where my wrists is
God'll judge, no conviction
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted
Moving my whip down the boulevard
Word 'round town, I was selling hard
Hard and I'm talking bout the yayo
Hit her on the floor and then I lay low
Amigos say "Que pasa with the pesos?"
Promethazine codeine, caseloads (T.R.U.)
And when I pull up to the valet
You know I got the strippers on payroll!
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G
This the shit they gon' buy
This the shit why I'm fly
This the shit why I'm high
This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want

[Post-Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
If you see my watch I might hit it
If you see my check I might hit it
If you see my house I might hit it
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
This the shit that's from me
This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
100k in my trunk
Keep that bitch with that donk
She gon' pop in them heels
She must heard of my deal
She gon' roll on them pills
Just don't grab on my hat
This that shit that's Iraq
This that make you climax
This that shit you just bought
This that Q go hamhawk
This that car that won't park
Pedal to floor, it won't stop
And just when you thought it won't drop
Oxymoron in stores
Come in, kids, lock the door
Knock-knock-knock, hit the floor
Need my bread off the top
Could buy anything off the lot
This that steel, not the grill
Get them slugs off for real
This that curl with the gel
We gon' win, smoke the L's
She love my mic, rock the bell
Leave that punani killed
All them hoes run to Q
Spit that truth, make the loot
Expensive whips, we hotbox
Spent 2 bills on my socks
This that make you cockblock
This that make me pop shot
This that filthy convo
This that must be Figueroa
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?

And then with that lick, it came with that yola

And see now your bitch, she gon' work on that corner

Give me racks and you won't get a quota
She don't run game, I'm the only controller
So what's up now? Straight pimpin' over here
And I put that shit on Vers, nigga

Nigga look, it's right here, bulldog bark, you could die right here
Real gangsta niggas don't have no fear
Real niggas never tattoo their tears
Hopping out of vans, disturbing your plans
All hoodied up, no Wu-Tang Clan
Three Js letting off through that Aryan, call that bitch 3 for 10
I'm fucking up the streets again
Tags on the toes all amongst your friends
Let the barrel spin, get blended in, embrace the funk
Groovy as I'm running through your system
Seem like you only target Hindu victims
Red dot, chicken pox type symptoms
Sad day, had his whole family sickened
Trying to state the facts
We don't care if he elect you black, we got a strap
Gangsta shit, she with me if I'm broke or rich, I got a bitch
Ain't sober, kush odor, kush sodas, crip stoner
Real soldier, head off shoulders, makeover

Take a sip with me, now move your hips with me
Now make it dip for me
Now will you ride for me? Will you die for me?
Will you jump off a cliff and hit the sky with me?
Uh, ménage à trois, four titties, no bras and no flaws
You, me, and her ball with no drawers
Get high with a God I am no star
Feeling good, all this money on my bank card

[Verse 1]
I'm a drug dealing nigga, 'cause them grades ain't get me paid
My agenda for today is to make bread or get laid
See my daughter need some shoes and my mom work overtime
So I'm standing by that stop sign with nickels and them dimes
Keep that work, got that Oxy, need that kilo, call that papi
Know my steelo, shrimp with sake, sold that her-on, look like toffee
Keep my nina, just might off him, no them boys on Figg don't play
Most my life on 51st, went to school on 52nd
Used to fight on 49th, Grandma said be home by night
But her old ass sixty-something, so three hours late aight
Still I love her, R.I.P., when she died, I took her place
And became a fucking G, moved my crack across the street
[Bridge]
Figg get it, get it, yeah
Drug dealing nigga (YAWK, YAWK, YAWK)

[Hook]
Had pistols in my hands, had pockets full of Oxy's
Whole life I been a G, had bitches on the block
Had strippers on the pole, had cocaine in the pot
Got fiends at the door, so I turned that to a rock

[Verse 2]
I'm a drug dealing nigga, roll my cyc' on Hoover Street
Just a year after Pac died we all bump Suga Free
Didn't know what he was saying 'til them years done jumped to three
Learned the game, slanging hoes and every car door need a key
Charge them smokers day through night; selling pies, who need a slice?
Life is craps so shoot the dice, get the cheese but cut the mice
Enemies be left to right, we don't call our shit the trap
Bitch we call our shit the set, unless we OD with Reynold's Wrap
After crack it's Oxy next, but thank God the yay was yay
Off the yee like it's the bay, rock a chain, I'm Kunta K
Out in Texas, what's the word, keep them packs and that's for sure
Slang to him and slang to her, ask a fiend they will concur
[Bridge]
Figg get it, get it, yeah
Drug dealing nigga (YAWK, YAWK, YAWK)

Had pistols in my hands, had pockets full of Oxy's

The Purge Lyrics[Intro: Joy]
My daddy said, "Yeah, nigga"
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Pow, pow, pow!) Coming in for yours
Niggas got them choppers and they knocking at your door
The sirens getting louder when the bodies hit the floor
Why you look confused? Motherfucker, this is war

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, nigga
Ugh, yeah, nigga

Ugh, yeah, nigga
Ugh, yeah, nigga
[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
As this G shit begin, put this product placement on your chin
The realest nigga breathing, y'all pretend
Real Crippy since I hopped off the swing
With my strap, that's my peace offering (Yo, yeah, uh, yeah)
Five shots get rung out, five bodies falling
Come put your lights out, I spark your apartment
Deadline my clothing, don't fuck with Pink Dolphin
Strap on his hairline, his forehead gets softened
Send extras through his chest bones, shit, he don't need that coffin
Most niggas would've run away, but me I'm out here walking
Bucket hat with my shades on, my wardrobe look awesome
Now, nah, I ain't on no dolphin, fuck rhyming, I'm Cripping
Niggas rap about what I'm living
All this false claiming, I'm marring
Doing drive-bys I ain't steering
White funerals, I ain't tearin'
Fuck your bitch in front of your children
Steal your whip side of my building, yeah
Put my dick and nuts in her mouth, bust in her hair
I'm very rare, got my trigger on top of my underwear
Bitch, I'm everywhere and over there
You die here, let off a pair (YAWK, YAWK)

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
House full of kilos, sold pound to zeros
Cocaine my hero, you in Figg Side, getting Deebo'd
Always asking for the burner, like, young niggas still freeload
Heart big as my ego, don't fly around my signal
I'll rearrange your dental, Crippy my house shoes
Blue-rag disciples, murder, I'm liable, you get the Eiffel
Aim out the eyeball, I'm getting violent, I got the strike once
Won't get the strike twice, you niggas half-price
Which means you half-off, I'm going Adolf
I'm smoking bath salt, two sherm sticks, burn this, ooh
Knock-knock through the condos
ScHoolboy from the five-deuce
But Hoover respect to you unranked
Don't fuck around, get that chin banged
Groovelining, Crip walk the whole mile
Blue Belts, still my pants down
Chuck Taylors, Cortezes, hush puppies
My Glock, yeah, fuck buddy, make money, take money
Earn crack money, drug money, bail money
Heard they got life for me, but how they got life for me
When they took that from me, since I had my nose runny
I was out past sunny, had the strap by my tummy
You can go and ask mommy, grab a body bag, homie, yeah
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Pow, pow, pow!) Coming in for yours
Niggas got them choppers and they knocking at your door
The sirens getting louder when the bodies hit the floor

Go so hard might harm myself

[Refrain: Schoolboy Q]
Yeah, nigga
Ugh, yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Yeah, it's Kurupt young mothafucking Gotti
Still rolling in a 6, I don't fuck with the Bugatti
Come up in this mothafucka looking for a bitch
She probably sucked on my dick then you kissed her on the lips
The integral, South Central sentinel
Get roped and choked, poetical tentacles stretch (ha ha ha ha)
Get roped and choked and rope-a-doped
Extra overdose of the oki-doke
Get a nigga smoked, I ain't no joke
Tired of this bullshit and everything y'all talk about
They walked 'em in, I walked 'em out
They talked 'em in, I chalked 'em out
Now cock back that Oxy (Pow-pow, pow-pow)
Walk inside, pistols popping, top is popping off
Papadopoulos neighborhood, rolling 60 balls
Ghetto tribalist, squeezing pussies like octopuses
Nigga, show me where the money at, show me where the kush is
Next time you see me I'll probably be in the bushes
This is the reasons why I won't be fucking with pussies like you
Me, Tyler, and ScHoolboy Q, we told 'em

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Pow, pow, pow!) Coming in for yours
Niggas got them choppers and they knocking at your door
The sirens getting louder when the bodies hit the floor
Why you look confused? Mothafucka, this is war

Prescription / Oxymoron Lyrics[Part 1: "Prescription"]

[Verse 1]
Prescription drugs, show me love
Percocets, Adderall
Xanny bars, get codeine involved
Stuck in this body high, can't shake it off
I'm falling off, I can't hold a thought
What's wrong with me? Now depression creep
I'm stressing deep, even in my sleep
My mommy call, I hit ignore
My daughter calls, I press ignore
My chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor
I'm blanking out, woke up on the couch
Dinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts
I had a ball sellin' 80s but yo, the karma's worse
I cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved
My senses harmed, sluggish ruggish
A couple Xannies popped, open my pill box
Prescription drugs
[Interlude: Joy]
Daddy, daddy
What's wrong, daddy?!
Wake up!
Wake up!

[Verse 2]
Prescription drugs, I fell in love
My little secret, she gon' kill a thug
My body numb, she like to give me hugs
I love her touch, I get a rush
When she don't come around, I start to go nuts
My heart erupts, I'm curled in pain
My phone ring, ring and ring and ring
If you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing
May 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6:45, I finally answer this time
He said "Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes"
I don't decline, at least that's in my mind
Grab the keys, need some 'Woods for the trees
Dap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC
Continue right, remember seeing light
Why it's night? But that's my life
Prescription drugs

[Outro: Joy]
What's wrong?
You tired?
You mad?
Okay, I love you, daddy

Uh, let me get some there for 20 dollars watch, 20 dollars

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Crazy, got my stash somewhere in her Mercedes
80's, get these off that new shoes for my baby
Oxy, I don't know no Pablo or no papi
What you know about a pill, plus a 8-ball
You gotta re-up 50 times just to get a rack off, ungh
I can get a hundred of 'em, make over 3 G's
Only took two days, only re-up'd one time
Where the sun barely shine and it rain for about
Nine months out the year, man it's something right here
For Seattle nigga, cheers
When I look up at y'all city like lookin' in the mirror
Damn near had a career, just might shed a tear, ungh
Man, this shit right here for my niggas who ain't make it home
Sitting on a tear, got a dap to a nigga bright in here
Feeling life ain't fair
If I was in your shoes, I would've copped, don't care
Had a scene, had the medics like clear, ungh
Big body cold like a Polar Bear, ungh
I done sold more shit than hookers
Expensive tees, resemble a push up
Stopped selling crack, cause white don't fuck with niggas
Uh—vanity slave, got whips and chains
Dirty money, clean money the same
Even if I got life I ain't saying a name
[Chorus]
Just stopped sellin' crack today (Crack today-day-day)
I just stopped sellin' crack today (What you say? What you say-say?)
O-X-Y, I'm moron
O-X-Y, I'm moron (Uh!)
Just stopped sellin' crack today (Crack today-day, yeah)
I just stopped sellin' crack today (What you say? What you say?)
O-X-Y, I'm moron
O-X-Y, I'm moron

[Verse 2]
Groovy, when I die tell Spike Lee make a movie
Ooh wee, cops bringing dogs
Hope they don’t sniff my bitch booty
Oxy, O-X-Y, only feel like I could stop me
Quincy, now how you nigga sliding up
Every now and then in a Bentley?
Easy, 60-40-50
You can get one for 30 if you let me hold your titty
Let a nigga fuck then my dogs see your kitty
Just stopped selling crack today
When it get hot, smoke a pill, watch it glide like Dr. J
I prescribe you, I'm your doctor, kay?
You can crush this shit, you can sniff this shit
You can take this shit, you can smoke this shit
Do you like this shit, nigga?
Your brain go numb, synthetic heroin
Without the injections, do the same love and affection
How could they say feeling good is an addiction?
But the world is full of shit, so I don't listen
In fact "We living to die" is a contradiction
So trapping in a Nissan, O-X-Y, I keep 'em, O-X-Y, you need one

[Chorus]
Just stopped sellin' crack today (Crack today-day-day)
I just stopped sellin' crack today (What you say? What you say-say?)
O-X-Y, I'm moron
O-X-Y, I'm moron (Uh!)
Just stopped sellin' crack today (Crack today-day, yeah)
I just stopped sellin' crack today (What you say? What you say?)
O-X-Y, I'm moron
O-X-Y, I'm moron

Tookie Knows II Lyrics[Intro: Schoolboy Q]
Ugh (Ugh), we might die for this shit, nigga
Ugh (Ugh, ugh), might go down for this shit, nigga

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Ga-gangbanging, that Crip shit
Nigga said "Cuz" in the first grade
In the shade where the cops can't see us (Can't see us)
Eighteen, tryna dodge the cage
It was cool 'til that gang sweep (Sweep)
Now I'm in back of a van and my wrists got a band (Got a band)
Got a number for a name (For a name)
No name on the visit, no call get accepted
Now I'm forced to a man (To a man)
Murder raps, where you from?
Put the nigga on his pockets
Watch the COs, they be watching (Watching)
Counting noodles for the hustle (Yeah)
County spread for the muscle
Couple marks on my knuckles (Yeah, yeah)
Puttin' niggas on bunk status (Yeah)
Shoulda been with the bitch-ass
Now he on a mattress that we bench-press
PC, get the Froot Loops (Ooh)
Keep tellin' on niggas
Why I fuck with that nigga? (Nah, ayy, nah, ayy, yeah)
Nigga made bail but I'm still at rage
Should I thank God for the hell I raised?
'Cause the nigga that snitch is gonna feel that grave, like
Ain't nothin' to a Loc, huh? (Huh)
Went missin' to his folks, I ain't in, I ain't know, huh? (Huh)
They ain't show up to the court, huh? (Huh)
But then charges gotta go, huh? (Huh)
A young nigga back on Figg (Ugh)
H-Crown on wig, shoestrings say where I'm from
On probation and got my gun
Other side goin' for that thumb (Blop-blop)
Motherfucker, I'm gangbanging (Ooh, ugh, Gotti)
[Verse 2: Traffic]
Nigga I'm blue'd up (Crip), blue Chucks
Blue tee, nigga, I keep it G (I keep it G)
Nigga, in the streets is where I be
I'm up like breakfast while niggas sleep (I got that...)
Me and Floyd posted on Figg (Posted)
Getting it in and moving it out
Getting it in and moving it out
I'm holding the heat, he watching the block
I'm watching for cops, I'm holding these rocks (Holding)
Fiends keep coming, this shit don't stop (Don't stop)
When it's war time, niggas get popped (Pop)
We might die for this shit, off tops
My nigga gon' ride for this Crip, no lie (Nigga)
But I ain't dead yet, nigga, thank God (Thank God)
Money got niggas lookin' at me all odd (What you...)
Broke-ass niggas better go get a job
Run up on me wrong, bitch nigga, get popped (Get popped)
I'm gon' ride for this shit, on Crip
A nigga gon' die for this shit if they trip
Four-fif extendo, with fifty in the clip
TF by my side, he stupid with this shit (That's my Loc)
Q in the ride gripping on the fifth (That's my Loc)
Run up on me wrong (Nigga, err)
My nigga, my nigga, I'm gangbanging
[Verse 3: TF]
Ugh, might go down for this check, nigga
Ugh, I might die for this set, nigga (Ayy)
I ain't trippin nigga, I ain't slipping
Nigga lying saying I ain't Cripping
Back to back, me and Tiny smack
I said back to back, straight cups of 'gnac
Niggas ask, "What he signed for?"
I got an eight ball, I got a Rondo
I got an AK, when that bitch spray
It's like pullin' strings on a lawnmower
Last time I seen jail, nigga
I was cell living, getting mail in it
I ain't even talking mail, nigga
PayPals for the cell, nigga (Ha)
Hit the streets and cause hell, huh?
School of hard knocks, fuck Yale, huh?
See me and Traffic like a orca, nigga
And the black-and-whites, love whale watch (Ugh)
Front-line like mailboxes (What?)
Five twelve, that's the numbers on it (What?)
May first, May deuce, May twelfth, members only (Agh)

Scratched down, I'm strapped down (Brr)
Might go down for this shit (What?)

Hoover Street Lyrics[Part 1]

[Verse]
I got that work, fuck Labor Day, just bought a gun
Fuck punching in
Throwing rocks, no hopscotch
Bet my 9 milli' hit the right spot
Bang!... Last night it was a dream
This morning a fantasy back when the only fan I had was a fiend
(Huhhuhhuh-huhhuh!)
Meet me by the Acura, cause the cops like
To get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea
But it's cool, I've been catching on to they formula
See I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'
Then rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo
The bad guy, never once been a ho's hero
He get zero, I said nada, bitch pass the 'cama (Uh, yeah)
[Chorus]
How'd it feel to be a real nigga? (I'm a product of a real nigga)
La-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)
Fuck with one of my real niggas
(Sunlight, night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?
(Sunlight, night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga (My whole life I've been a real nigga)
La-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)
Fuck with one of my real niggas
(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?

[Part 2]

[Chorus]
I done jumped up off my ass
Hit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him
But... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)
But... Me Glock clock familia (Boom)
[Verse 1]
Find a nigga realer than me, my socks stink (yeah)
Eat so much pussy that my mustache pink
Strapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt, gangsta lean help
Hoodie on backwards, with the eyes cut out
My hate felt my .45 elder, poetry's deep
I never fail ya, ScHoolboy bust flame
Orange-yellow higher than Margielas, since a young nigga
I admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal
From his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout
Think about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday
He still get a hit, whether jacking radios or sucking dick
Sell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips
Cause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much
To get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work
Unless we rewind, and answer my church
Times getting harder, than my dick on a growth spurt
Around the same time, all you niggas was on purp, my sober ass Was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck
Freeze! Give me the keys, extra Fritos, chili and
Cheese! Threw some Baby Lucas in his eyes, before I
Leave! The cops'll never get the lead, grandma taught me well
And my uncle gun, was the accessory, 211 sipping, plus a robbery

[Refrain]
This little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome
[Chorus]
I done jumped up off my ass
Hit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him
But... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)
But... Me Glock clock familia (Boom)

[Verse 2]
Grandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more
She always got me things, that we couldn't afford
The new Js and Tommy Hill in my drawers
Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, see Golden Eye was away at war
We wasn't thinking of getting money then
Nor did I wonder why, my uncle done sold his Benz
Cause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down
I also notice moms be locking doors, when he around
But anyways, his wife done left him and now he living with us
My bike is missing, Grandma like to hide her check every month
My uncle's nuts, he used to give me whiskey to piss in cups
Knocking on the door telling me to "Hurry up!", he in a rush
I gave it to him, then got my ass whipped for doing it
Moms used to tell me like, "Nigga, know who you dealing with."
Them was the good days ,'til I was raised the older ways
Rat-Tone, my nigga's brother showed me my first K
I was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back
He called us over like - HEY!
YAWK, YAWK, YAWK, YAWK! We like -"Daaaaaamn, nigga"
Then again - YAWK, YAWK! We like, "Daaaaaamn, nigga!"
Hearing him say "Cuz'", turned us to a faaaaaan, nigga!
Later on he got locked, so now we're taking his fades
Continue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page
Gangbanging was a ritual and Grandma would help
She should've never left her gun on the shelf

[Refrain]
This little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome

[Chorus]
I done jumped up off my ass
Hit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him
But... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)
But... Me Glock clock familia (Boom)
