Bust down on my wrist in this bitch
My pinky-ring bigger than his
Met her out in Beverly Hills, ayy
Dolla got too many girls, ayy
Met her out in Beverly Hills
All she wear is red bottom heels
When she back it up, put it on the Snap
When she droppin' low, put it on the Gram

I'm having another good year, we don't get blimps for that
Pussy game still cold, we don't get minks for that
When I'm poppin' them bananas, we don't link chimps for that
I gave these bitches two years, now your time's up
Bless her heart, she throwing shots but every line sucks
I'm in that cherry red foreign with the brown guts
My shit slappin' like dude did LeBron's nuts

The Other Side Lyrics[Prod. by Joshua "Ammo" Coleman and Martin Johnson]
[Verse 1]
In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin'
Smilin' in the photo booth
But we got closer (Yeah)
'Til you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We’re going all the way"
[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

[Verse 2]
Wait, this could be perfect (Yeah)
But we won't know unless we try (Try)
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We’re going all the way"

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side
[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Kiss me like it's do or die
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And take me to the other side

[Bridge]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We’re going all the way"

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July (Yes they do, yeah)
Just take me to the other side (Take me, baby)
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight (So tonight)
Kiss me like it's do or die (Kiss me, kiss me)
And take me to the other side

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Take me to the other side
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And take me to the other side

If I let go I know, I'll regret it
Every heart that I held before, I was sure to break it

Got me 'bout to break my neck, tell me how you pop like that

I can't be mad at that baby fat (woo)
That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty
[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)
If she keeps blowing, it might explode, never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo, oh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
You do it like a professional, but you gon' get on schedule
Looking so pretty in pink, acting like your shit don't stank
You do it all day in the mirror (all day), you practice all day in the mirror (all day)
Left cheek, right cheek all year, I'm calling you out and I hope you hear it

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty (woo)
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty (woo)
Drop a dollar on the floor hope she give it to me (woo)
A ghetto booty, a ghetto booty (woo)
She dump that trunk but she don't look back (woo)
She put it in reverse and I can't be mad (woo)
I can't be mad at that baby fat (woo)
That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)
If she keeps blowing, it might explode, never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo, oh, yeah)
[Verse 3: Tyga]
Ha, blow it like a bubble, bazooka, baby
Clouds on the couch, you my hookah, baby
She got that senile, make a grown man crazy
Got that senile, make a grown man crazy
Ha, shawty in the gym, ass-mazin' (agh)
I pull up, I get her, as easy
It's too late to go back, she look back, I'm cheesin'
I'm Kodak, my Rolex, a moment, the history
Yeah, pussy bomb, tick-tock (agh)
Eyes lock, lip lock, thing pop, I'm done (agh)
T-Raww, heart numb, no love, heart spun
Baby, give me some yum yum (woo)
Big wheelie, surfboard (yeah, surfboard)
Wheelie on the jock, do your thang, girl
And I need me a ride or die and you's a freak
I got seven different girls every day of the week but

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo & Tyga]
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty (woo) (agh, yeah)
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty (woo)
Drop a dollar on the floor hope she give it to me (woo)
A ghetto booty, a ghetto booty (woo)
She dump that trunk but she don't look back (woo)
She put it in reverse and I can't be mad (woo)
I can't be mad at that baby fat (woo)
That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty
[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)

She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)17Embed

If It Ain’t Love Lyrics[Intro]
(Could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use, could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use...)

[Verse 1]
Short days, long nights, tangled up with you
I don't wanna move
Your eyes don't lie
And if I needed proof, that body tell the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Your body is a blessing
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't know if I deserve it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Before round two, I've got a question for you, babe
[Chorus]
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
Why does it feel so good?

[Post-Chorus]
If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why does it feel so good?

[Break]
(Could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use, could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use...)
[Verse 2]
On the tip of my tongue
The flavor of your skin lingers on my lips
Each time we dine
We do it again, again and again, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Your body is a blessing, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
What'd I do to deserve it? (What'd I)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Before round three, I've got a question for you, baby

[Chorus]
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good? (So good)
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
Why does it feel so good?
Tell me what it is

[Post-Chorus]
If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Oh, babe
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why does it feel so good? (So ggod)
If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Then what is it?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why does it feel so good?
[Break]
(Could use a little love) Aw, yeah
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use, could use)

[Bridge]
You know soon that you walk in, it going up, going up
Slow it down for me, girl, we ain't gotta rush it (we ain't gotta rush)
Always a movie, we ain't saying much
Baby, I'm just your type, I know what bad girls like
But I'll confess tonight
Your body is a blessing, oh yeah
What'd I do to deserve it?
(Short days, long nights)
Short days and long nights, yeah

[Chorus]
If it ain't love
(Why) Why does it feel so good?
(Does it feel) Why does it feel so good?
(So good) Tell me what it is
If it ain't love
(Why) Why does it feel so good?
(Does it feel) Why does it feel so good?
(So good) So good, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
If it ain't love (woo)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Why) What is it?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Does it feel) What is it?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (So good)
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Why) Then what is it?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Does it feel) What is it?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (So good)
Why does it feel so good?

[Outro]
(Could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use, could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use, could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)2Embed
