Love Sosa Lyrics[Intro: Jordan Gilty & Chief Keef]
Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barber shop
"Chief Keef ain't 'bout this, Chief Keef ain't 'bout that"
My boy a BD on fucking Lamron and them
He, he, they say that nigga don't be putting in no work
Shut the fuck up
Y'all niggas ain't know shit
All y'all motherfuckers talkin' about
"Chief Keef ain't no hitter
Chief Keef ain't this
Chief Keef a fake"
Shut the fuck up
Y'all don't live with that nigga
Y'all know that nigga got caught with a ratchet
Shootin' at the police and shit
Nigga been on probation since fuckin' I don't know when
Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that
Them niggas savages out there
If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Chief Keef
I'm fucking beatin' they ass
I'm not fucking playin' no more
Y'all know them niggas roll with Lil Reese and them

Love No Thotties Lyrics[Intro]
Hang up on me one more time and see what happens
I ain't gon' hang up on you
Where you at though?
I'm in Chicago, Chiraq
Country?
Huh?
When are you coming out here?
When you finna come out here?
You know what I meant
Your ass drunk
What you say?
You're drunk
Why, why you act like you know me or something?
'Cause I know you, what you'll do to a nigga
Why you playing like you know me?
[Verse]
These bitches act local and think global
Never seen a hundred thousand, well, let me show you
What you want to drink? I know you hate being sober
And I know all these niggas hate Chief Sosa
I'm cruising in my 'Rari with my Louis loafers
Bitch, I'm a Rastafari, I'm a toolie toter
Wish a nigga would try to screw me over
Now I got blood on my Louis loafers
I wear thousand dollar belts 'cause I'm a rich nigga
Nina like a boxer bitch the way she hit niggas
Shoes cost a bunch of shit, look at my kicks, nigga
I could've bought a ass for my bitch, nigga
I'm off this Actavis, it got me leanin' over
I poured a four of purple in some peach soda
Yo' boyfriend an opp, I'll make Nina blow him
You was on the phone with him, sucking my dick, and he ain't even know it
(Hang up on me one more time)
I ain't even try to
You wanna Glo up, baby, Keef got you
You's a gold bottle, these hoes pink Moscato
Baby, I'm the owner, you can be my castle
(Hahaha, why you gotta be all that?)
Baby, 'cause I like you
Only reason I text you or why I Skype you
I just wanna fuck on you, I don't wanna wife you
But you gotta brush your teeth and do what I say to
(Hello?)
Bitch, can you hear me?
Keep your pussy in park, no 360
That boy said he getting guap, no, he didn't
I'm Almighty Sosa, it's complete mission
(Where you at?)
I'm nowhere around you
I'm high off this earth, I can't come back down to
Baby, this a song, I just thought I'd tell you
I would send you off but I don't wanna mail you
(Be quiet)
I don't wanna smell you
'Cause I'ma cut you off quicker than I met you
I'ma swipe your name up off my schedule
And if smoke this blunt, girl, I'm gon' forget you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha)
I ain't even playing though
I make bitches fly like Peter Pan do
(When I'ma see you?)
That's why I just ask you
You's a alcoholic, I ain't got no time for you
(Hey, can you get the water?)
Is you off the molly?
If I book your flight, is you gonna top me?
(Don't worry, I will)
Okay, you got me

War Lyrics[Intro]
Boy don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war

[Chorus]
Boy don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war
Don't want war
Pussy boy...
Don't want war

Pussy boy don't want it
Pussy boy...
Pussy boy, pussy boy
Pussy boy
[Verse]
Nigga fuck your mama, she should’ve wore a condom
Pull up in that 'Rari, burning off this rubber
Niggas undercover, so you know I can’t trust them
I be smoking earth boy, you be smoking bubba
The bitch like Benihana's, took that bitch to McDonald's
I got plenty condoms and I got plenty commas
If you want some beef boy, I won't be your farmer
I might be your father, ball like Penny Hardaway
Judge trying to lock me up, cause my pee look darker
But that ain't gon' solve none, weed solve my problem
Guns for my armor, nigga fuck security
Out the cut like barbers, got niggas Forrest Gumping
Smoking on this Compton, but bitch I'm in Chiraq
Where you disrespect me at, bitch that's where you die at
All these fucking lab rats, now I got my mouse trap
Niggas wanna fake kick, wanna know where my house at
That life I ain't bout that, I'm 'bout  pushing scalps back
Pull up on yo block, bitch, let my niggas out that
Foreign car, clout that, I'm high off this Tooka pack
I'm high off this Aiki pack, I'm high off this Tu-Tu pack
Smoking on that Jay Loud, smoking on that FatHead
Run up on 46, leave a nigga flat dead
Shoot a 47, flying off like Batman
Boy I got a bad bitch, put that bag on that head
I'm high off this Chief Keef, got me feeling like Superman
That bitch called Chief Keef G, bitch I'm not no MuBu man
All these damn frenemies, I'ma call up PooPoo man
I got niggas in these streets, they fuck around and do you, man
I’m rich, hallelujah man, still got my toolie man
Fuck with me, I’ll fuck around and screw your mans
Flexin' like a ruler, shoot at your medulla man
And get your bitch, she wanna suck my dick, I knew it man
[Chorus]
Pussy boy don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war
Don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war

Pussy boy don't want war

Pussy boy don't want war, don't want war, want war

[Outro]
Come down your block like thunder, thunder, thunder

Pussy how you warrin'?

Sosa Chamberlain Lyrics[Intro]
What is GLO GANG? Well it's GLO GANG is G-L-O-G-A-N-G
It is Glory Boyz, we are Glory Boyz Entertainment. It is GBE
But it's shortened, it's shortened, you know what I'm sayin'
So it's G-L-O Gang, and so the GLOry Boyz
You guys can say either one though, it don't matter
You know what I'm sayin'
I won't get offended, gang won't get offended
We are Glory Boyz, you know what I'm sayin'
But GLO GANG is just a, just a short abbreviation for Glory Boyz
You know what I'm sayin', just G-L-O-G-A-N-G, you know
We be on a lotta gang shit, we got everybody sayin' "gang" now
No squad, you know. We changed that, we changed to gang
It ain't none of that squad. I mean you know we got Savage Squad
You know that's my cousin, Fredo and nem. But um shit
We go by gang and none of that squad
But when cuz and nem come around you know it's squad
When Wop come around we rockin' with the squad
You know what I'm sayin'. But when we
When it's just gang, we be on that straight gang shit
You know what I'm sayin', gang and none of that squad
But anyways man back to the tape man
[Verse 1]
Yo bitch got that wet wet, my gun got that wet wet
She let me fuck up in the car, now my seats is wet wet
I'm off the drank wet wet, your dope smell like a wet pack
She said she wanna smoke with we, bitch you should've said that
She said that she gotta pee, I'm like bitch you should've said that
She said she been said that, I said I ain't hear that
I was smoking the loudest loud but I'm always ready
You be smokin' on that shit, that shit that give you headache
Who come here, you come here
Ooh come here, pistol to your ear
Booze what you sip, lean what I sip
Water what I drink, cat meow all I get
Pull up to the strip, thing on my hip
The police pull me over like It's weed on my lip
Johnny call me up, he said he peed on my wrist
Yo bitch call me Marshall she said she bleached all my gear
My daughter call me mad, she said she gon' eat all my chips
These niggas always mad they wanna eat all my dip
The opps always mad they say Chief Keef ain't blowin' shit
Until I come through blastin' like the Heat I ain't doin' shit

[Chorus]
I'm Sosa Wilt Chamberlain, blunts just flamin'
Watch just blingin', phone just rangin'
I'ma no belt rockin', no sock rockin'
Pull up show stoppin', you know how I'm rockin'

Sosa whats your language? Bitch I speak them acres
Favorite team the Lakers, favorite team the Bulls
Wanna put up your paper? I'm like okay cool
[Verse 2]
My favorite player Butler, and I gotta butler
Gotta number 40, my 40 a fuck ya
My favorite player Rose, aye, money on him let's go

That mean that I can hold it, hold it underwater
Pull up on your daughter I'm a shark up in the water
I remember buying quarters, now I'm at a P
When it come to your bitch, I gotta add a Keef
Come out the cut like Snell, I gotta add a three
Don't give a fuck how you feel

Superheroes Lyrics[Hook: Chief Keef]
By myself cause these niggas yes men
Bitch I'm Almighty Sosa Batman
Know I got my Smith & Wesson
That be my illegal weapon
I'm off this Earth I feel like Superman
Cocky like He-Man, cut like Wolverine
Come through yo' block like Green Goblin
Wetting shit up Spiderman

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Come through your block, ay
Like Batman with a Glock, ay
Red beams on the gun bitch, Cyclops, ay
Wonder Woman, I name my watch, ay
I got my heat, I feel like He-Man
Bought sandman to the beach so bitch I'm Seaman, ay
I got a cold from all this ice man, ay
Don't make me flash my fuckin' pipe man, ay
I'm Spiderman, my uncle got killed off white man
Come through your block, Star Wars with the shots
Daredevil with a cane cause I'm shootin' like I'm blind, ay
Smokin' Liu Kang kush, Sub-Zero, the whole nine, ay
Now I'm feelin' like I'm Walkin' Dead bitch, Sosa Rick Grimes
[Hook: Chief Keef]
By myself cause these niggas yes men
Bitch I'm Almighty Sosa Batman
Know I got my Smith & Wesson
That be my illegal weapon
I'm off this Earth I feel like Superman
Cocky like He-Man, cut like Wolverine
Come through yo' block like Green Goblin
Wetting shit up Spiderman

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Flacko order quarter coke straight from Sosa man
That's that soda, eyes the color of Coca-Cola cans
Green like Cloverland, everyday I'm blowin' grams
Everything is purple, guess I am the Joker then
Life's a game of poker, tell that nigga "show your hand"
I'm pullin' cards, I think it's time you niggas fold again
Told you soldiers with the scope I show attack
Told you, blow you, John Doe you then
Now nobody know the man, damn
From rippin' the Benz
Flippin' the rims, flippin' a fifth to a gram
Now I get in advance, I'm rich again
Switchin' more bitches in France
We ain't rapin' hoes, but we we out here cookie stealin'
You Captain Save-A-Hoe, nigga I'm the pussy villain
Spiderman, Peter Parker, I'm like Peter Pan
Treat my ops like Cyclops if I see the man
Wolverine in skinny jeans, diamonds Billy Jean
They tap dance, the Batman is a black man
[Hook: Chief Keef]
By myself cause these niggas yes men
Bitch I'm Almighty Sosa Batman
Know I got my Smith & Wesson
That be my illegal weapon
I'm off this Earth I feel like Superman
Cocky like He-Man, cut like Wolverine
Come through yo' block like Green Goblin
Wetting shit up Spiderman83Embed

Bang
Skrr
You are now rocking with Frencizzle the French hitmaker
Sosa
What you want?
Shit

[Verse]
I'm startin' off my day with a blunt of Earth (Dope, dope)
Lookin' myself up, see how much I'm worth
I'm ridin' down the block in this silver Porsche (Skrr, skrr)
That bitch already know that I'ma flirt

You get 8 bars for 10 (Bars), 12 for that times 2
50 for a show, 20 for a verse
As soon as I'm done I'm countin' like a nerd (Nerd)
My baby need some new and she get it first (KayKay)
I'ma be sober real soon so I need some herb
I hopped out of that 'Rari with that Louis bag
And if a nigga try me, foenem do his ass (Bang)
I'm countin' a million dollars in my mansion (Yah)
Hoes everywhere, I got bitches dancin' (Thots)
Choppas in the closet, pounds in the den (Bang)
We got the 30's on us, meet that many men (Bang)
Couple M16, this ain't new for us (Top)
All my niggas standing tall on my front porch
I got 3 cars up in my garage
Have my niggas in yo grass, bitch, camoflouge (Bang)
