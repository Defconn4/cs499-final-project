If he step on these, I might just fuck around and sock him (Bitch)
Dangle that boy over a ledge and then I drop him (Bye)
Shoot a bullet straight through his head, I solved the problem (Boom, boom)
Not going back and forth on the 'Gram, I had to block him (No)
Rather catch him lackin' in public and then pop him (Come here)
Caught him on the elevator, had to 2Pac him (Bitch)
I'ma pull a Biggie Smalls, nigga don't know who shot him

FIND HIM! Lyrics[Chorus]

Shot up his whip, now he stuck with a flat (Boom)
Hit a home run, made him run to his house
Got niggas there posted, scopin' it out
He only got killed 'cause he wouldn't close his mouth
Talk foul, then we gunnin' him down
Gas so loud that it smell like a sound (Bitch)
And I smoke out the pound so no turnin' it down (Bitch, bitch)

Let It Eat Lyrics[Chorus: Comethazine]

I BE DAMNED Lyrics[Intro: Prince Oji]
Bitch
This nigga Comethazine keeps the strap on him
Do not run up on that nigga
He will shoot your ass, he will shoot a nigga down
Ahh

[Chorus: Comethazine & Prince Oji]
I'll be damned if I lack without my mop
Send shooters at your top 'cause I ain't have time to send them shots
Your bitch gon' up that top when she see me 'cause she a thot
Point chopper at your top then let it pop, then watch you drop (He will shoot your ass)
I'll be damned if I'm caught lackin' with no pole
Put dick up in her throat then make her go 'cause she a ho
This chopper got a scope, I aim that beam right at your nose
She hopped up in my Ghost then we went home, she lost her clothes (He will shoot your ass)
I'll be damned if I lack without my mop
Send shooters at your top 'cause I ain't have time to send them shots
Your bitch gon' up that top when she see me 'cause she a thot
Point chopper at your top then let it pop, then watch you drop (He will shoot your ass)
I'll be damned if I'm caught lackin' with no pole
Put dick up in her throat then make her go 'cause she a ho
This chopper got a scope, I aim that beam right at your nose
She hopped up in my Ghost then we went home, she lost her clothes (He will shoot your ass)
[Verse: Comethazine]

Made that bitch walk home 'cause I ain't have Uber app on my phone
That boy say he want smoke, just one click'll get a nigga gone

Bitch, I got rich quick, bitch, did this shit all alone

Was a no-show to class, a no-show to school
Now they want me doin' shows for the school
When I made a milli', boy, I had to move (Bye)
Went straight for the Hills, we in Malibu
These hoes like Blac Chyna, they pussy ran through (Ew)
Me, I fuck models and bitches in movies
I can't hit you back, I can't fuck with groupies
She probably got herpes, she probably got cooties (Ew)
I brought a projector, my crib like the movies
I smoke out the pound while I'm watching The Goonies
These niggas gay, these niggas fruity
Threw him in a blender then made me a smoothie

Just Saying Lyrics[Intro]
If you ain't got no diamonds on your neck, then how you drippin' then?

[Chorus]
If you ain't got no diamonds on your neck, then how you drippin' then?
And if you ain't pourin' up and sippin' Tech, then what you sippin' on?
If you ain't got a chopper or a TEC, then what you grippin' on?
If you ain't smokin' grandma cookie thrax, then what you trippin' on?
If you not really 'bout to throw it back, then why you strippin' then?
If you ain't pull up in this white Hellcat, then what you dippin' in?
And if you're not gon' contribute to my money, mind your business then
And if he knows where and when and what I did, I kill the witness then

[Verse]
Just like a Bic lighter, lit him like a cig, then I finished him
Pull out, shoot a nut to her wig, then dismiss the ho
Had to locate, find out where he live, then get rid of him
Shoot her in her face with my kids, show her to the door
Bitch, I live by the gun, ducking pigs, I can never go
Semi, semi automatic, long dick, drop him to the floor
Johnny Dang diamonds sit right by my lip, this a twenty piece
Vintage Givenchy in large print on my sweater sleeve
[Chorus]
If you ain't got no diamonds on your neck, then how you drippin' then?
And if you ain't pourin' up and sippin' Tech, then what you sippin' on?
If you ain't got a chopper or a TEC, then what you grippin' on?
If you ain't smokin' grandma cookie thrax, then what you trippin' on?
If you not really 'bout to throw it back, then why you strippin' then?
If you ain't pull up in this white Hellcat, then what you dippin' in?
And if you're not gon' contribute to my money, mind your business then
And if he knows where and when and what I did, I kill the witness then
