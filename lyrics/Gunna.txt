Sold Out Dates Lyrics[Intro: Gunna]
Yeah, yeah
Young, young, young Gunna, yeah
Run that back, Turbo
Baby

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade
[Verse 1: Gunna]
'Nother backend, I'm back on the road
Flooded Patek, paid off a show
Drippin' is rare, more this Vlone
Hoes by the pair, I'm never alone
Sleep on the Lear, Comme des Garçons
Drop eight in a two and let it dissolve
Balmain my denim, young GunWunna ball
Rock the whole concert and hopped in a frog
My foreign's a toy, I'm still a kid
10K this year for Coachella, it's lit
Rolls got umbrellas to cover her wig
Open Ceremony, left them in a trench
Lightning bolt diamonds 'cause I want revenge
We straight like a line, man, I really got rich
Some more fancy yellow diamonds in my piss
Don't get it confused, I'm still bangin' the six
New Cartier, Gunna a don
Niggas tryna soak up the drip like a sponge
Hatred's contagious, I keep me a gun
I'm focused on makin' a M in a month
Baby order twenty thousand in ones
Walk in and buy, I'm not asking how much
Red on the bottom, you need to catch up
Consistently droppin', I need me a dub
[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Me and young Gunna back at it again
We just left New York, double datin' with twins
I just bought a Wraith, I retired the Benz
I fired my bitch and I hired her friend
I see all the hate through these Cartier lens
Every two months tryna put up an M
My dog caught a body, they got it on film
He still rockin' Gucci watches in the pen
Take a trip 'round the globe then we do it again
Got 'em watchin' my drip, guess I'm settin' the trend
Louis backpack, hit the jet and I'm gone
I don't post what I do 'cause these niggas be clones
See these diamonds they hittin', these VVS stones
Got a championship ring, I just brought it home
FN is plastic, them bullets like pellets
This Givenchy jacket, this ain't Pelle Pelle
Sold out dates, you know I don't play
The last eight months straight, got no time for breaks
On they neck 'til it breaks, ain't pushin' no brakes
I got on two watches, I still come in late
It feel like my birthday, I'm gettin' this cake
I pop like I got it, I'm holdin' my weight
I control the projects, I'm pushin' this weight
I'm sippin' this sizzurp, I poured me an eight
[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade38Embed

DOLLAZ ON MY HEAD Lyrics[Intro: Gunna]
Pull up with a stick, I pull up with a stick (Mike WiLL Made-It)
I'll pull up with a pink toe, I'm whippin', she suckin' this dick (Ear Drummers)
I put some diamonds on her toes, let that ho know that I'm rich
We was used to pullin' kick doors (That money go for Myles)

[Chorus: Gunna]
I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said
I'm a leader, I got 'em followin' my footsteps like the feds
I shoot like I'm Montana, chopper bullets make 'em shed, uh
Black on black new Phantom, in the backseat sippin' red, uh
Bitch, I'm from Atlanta where these hoes ride the dick like peg, yeah
Condo like the pharmacy, I got codeine in my fridge, pour up
[Verse 1: Gunna]
My bro on a steamin' stove, cookin' crack like grits
Got this vibe on her tippy toes, strokin' her in a pent'
LA live, I'm stayin' at the Loews with this Hollywood bitch
Got a nine and a snubnose (Let's go), can't wait to let it hit (Hit)
Pull up with a stick, I'll pull up with a stick
I'll pull up with a pink toe, I'm whippin', she suckin' this dick
I'll put some diamonds on her toes, let that ho know that I'm rich (Let that ho know that I'm rich)
We was used to pullin' kick doors, you could still call it a lick (Lick)
You broke and can't be fixed (Nah), went to Neimans and spent a nick (Hah)
How you poor? That don't make sense (Ah), I made a whole mile off an inch (An inch)
I had ninety-nine problems, I just scratched your ho off the list (Scratched your ho off the list)
Got some millions and went and solved 'em, now my neck cost a quarter brick (Brick)

[Chorus: Gunna]
I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said
I'm a leader, I got 'em followin' my footsteps like the feds
I shoot like I'm Montana, chopper bullets make 'em shed, uh
Black on black new Phantom, in the backseat sippin' red, uh
Bitch, I'm from Atlanta where these hoes ride the dick like peg, yeah
Condo like the pharmacy, I got codeine in my fridge, pour up

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Bestie, bestie, I just hit my friend
Told her "Catch me" (Woah), "Catch me" (Woah), I'ma lick her skin
She so precious, precious, might not fuck again
She too messy, messy, but hittin', no flexin' (No flexin')
Rose gold ornaments (Rose)
Dropped the two tint, car came with no tint (Damn)
You don't gotta use the door, you can hop in front of tip
Bond 9 in the vent, think 'bout dyin' and get spent
I got two B's on my boxers and a thottie in the bed (Yeah)
I know niggas ran up a milli', still didn't tell 12 shit (12, 12, 12, shh)
I got skeletons in my closets (Woah), and they scared of me and shit (Closets and they scared)
Maison Margielas under the bed screamin', "Rock me, kid" (Woah)
I put water on my head, then she got seasick (I put water on my head)
Couple opps played dead (What?), and they still got hit
I done bent lil' mama's spine but that still ain't my kid (Still ain't my kid)
Only reason I answer my line (Why?), is 'cause she drink my spit (No cap)
[Chorus: Gunna]
I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said
I'm a leader, I got 'em followin' my footsteps like the feds
I shoot like I'm Montana, chopper bullets make 'em shed, uh

I'm chubby, but shit, my pockets in shape, uh
Got racks all inside the safe
If I run out of space, stay booked out of state

[Verse 4: Young Thug & Gunna]
Top off the Benz, the one with no space
It's drivin' itself, hit the gas and the brakes
I had her bent inside of the Wraith
Besides the tint, the curtain in the way
I had to sprint all way to the end
I lost some old friends, couldn't keep up the pace
Copped the new Lam' and put it on land
These fuck niggas mad, I see it in they face
The jet that I'm on, it's sponsored by Wraith
I'm dodging the rain and I'm dodging the hate
I don't need a pass 'cause I'm not in school
You playin', you gon' be another cold case
My diamonds gon' dance, they come and enhance
My dick in her hand, I bet it get ate
I spent sixty bands on one of my cases
The paperwork in, my co-D is safe
YSL, we the guys
We murder him and his tribe

This city is mine 'til I die, ah
Patek the rock, ah
Soon up, we shoot at your spot, ah
Perfectly aim for the top, ah
Fuckin' your ho 'til she tired, yeah

Keep sendin' him Dots
I'm gon' free my cousin, I won't let him rot
You sent me a dyke
I fucked her so good, I got her back right
It's locked, and she got shark jaws
But I never want the key to the heart, nah

And love it when I'm rappin' with a guitar
We really came from the A
My shit flowin', havin' plenty of bars

She freaky, pulled up without no pantyhose
I'm stacking these benjamins, try not to boast
Bought some exclusive drip on Melrose
Fuck the judge, gave my cousin elbow
Locked him up, put him in a hellhole
They hope that he rotting out in mildew
Ain't seen him since my first year of high school
I'ma pay his way out for 'bout a mill' or two
Ten years riding, I made sure he had some food
I held that shit down, now look what we can do

[Chorus]
Ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
More bookings and payments that shit done got huge (Shit done got huge)
Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon (Gone)
Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool (Yeah)
Her pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube (Lube)
Good head on her shoulders like she still in school (Uh)
Pour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu
Loyalty mandatory, you part of this crew (Part of this crew)
Spending addiction, ten thousand on shoes (Spending addiction)
Spend with no limit, a hundred on jewels (A hundred on jewels)
Too many bitches, they coming in twos
I took a Perc', I been itching since noon (Itching since noon)
Why the brokest the loudest in the room? (Loudest)
Why all the sudden niggas want to be cool? (Want to be cool)
Ain't giving second chances, I'm no fool (Nah)
I'm out my depression, life been going smooth (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
Crew full of winners, no way we can lose
I learned from mistakes, won't take another loss
Vibes in the Sprinter, headed to the mall
I rock flawless diamonds, please accept my flaws
I'm getting that money, money over all
If broke is your problem cash is gonna solve it
If she sell pussy better have some bond nigga
Hit you up high, you leaping like a frog (Frog)
Making these hits, I'm feeling like a batter
Bought myself a ladder, I'ma stack it tall (Tall)
Gunna don't pay attention to these blogs
They saying shit, I let this money talk (Oh, yeah)
Diamonds on me look like some glass shattered
My bitch's ass fatter, keep a nigga hard (Oh, yeah)
Cars got some custom seats, they can massage
Convertible coming at the end of March

[Chorus]
Ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
More bookings and payments that shit done got huge (Shit done got huge)
Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon (Gone)
Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool (Yeah)
Her pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube (Lube)

Who You Foolin Lyrics[Intro]
Wheezy outta here
Huh, uh

[Chorus]
Who think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
Hawks game on the wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

[Verse 1]
We don't need no one vouchin' for us
I've been grindin' and found me a buzz
I've been searchin' for love and found lust
It's so hard to stop holdin' a grudge
My lil' dawg split your shit like a Dutch
My whole squad kept the kid in the cut
Keep your strap 'cause these niggas play tough
Pick and choose who the right one to trust
Pick and choose who the right one to trust
Keep it real, it's a lot of fake love
Niggas hate but they bitches in love
Paint the Bentley all white like a dove
I took off, ain't the same as it was
Kicked her out, told her walk to the bus
I'm a sipper, can tell when it's cut
You can't tell me that she ain't a slut
[Chorus]
Who think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
Hawks game on the wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

[Verse 2]
I don't need no one vouchin' for me
I be flossin', ain't talkin' 'bout my teeth
Car push-start, I keep losin' the keys
Chanel, Boss my closet full of C's
My shit wet Eliantte, VVs
I got pearls 'round my neck, not no beads
I get cash in my bag while I'm sleep
New blue face, two-tone Patek Philippe
Beverly Center, shoppin' spree on me
New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't no one of my foreigns on E
All my bitches got expensive weave
I sip drank for my pain to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs
And we take off the top for a breeze
[Chorus]
Who think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
Hawks game on the wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much

.223 Lyrics[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in that side of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't never been worn
Receivin' the prices, we sell out the dorm
Sky-Dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on

Hah, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
Headlining, we selling out like they Jordans
Cashing out numerous thousands in Barneys
You gon' swallow this cum 'fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships, we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it
[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
This is a Bentley, bitch, this not a Lexus (Skrrt)
You beat me to the club like a domestic
I came to the club and they gave me a section (Vroom)
Hop in my truck and my truck all matte black
Saint Laurent trench coat, Rick Owens my jacket
Pull up, I Lam' it, no I won't crash it
Rockstar lifestyle like my name Lenny Kravitz
Cartier diamonds, the frame in my glasses
No, no, no, you can not get these lens crafters
I shook his hand I was smiling and laughing
We killed that nigga, came out like, “What happened?“ (What happened?)
What happened, lil nigga? What happened?
It's Mister Geeked-Up, I'm never not laughing
I stay with my twin like my name is Shannon
Blacken my fish, and no pink call it salmon (Yeah)

Pussy cool but her head is retarded
Make one false move and your head is a target (Target)
Lot of drip and I still ain't rewarded (Uh, uh, uh)
Still ball with my crew like I play with the Hornets
Rage EDM like my bro DJ Carnage
I can walk in Magic, turn the weather to stormy (Stormy)
These four bitches wanna give me an orgy (Uh)
You hear the horses when we runnin' these Porsches
Drop the top off it like I get sore
Come see the paint on my Christian Dior (Christian Dior)
Comin' up really had this shit hard
Now bet you won't see me shoppin' in Zara (Shoppin' in Zara)
Went straight on the white, I got hard
Sixty whole rounds in that mini-AR (Mini-AR)
Comin' up some of my dogs caught the yard

TOP FLOOR Lyrics[Intro: Travis Scott]
(Run that back, Turbo)
(Wheezy outta here)
Jumped out of a wave right into a daze
It can wreck your life, you gotta think twice
Put it together, the color I like
Know it look better whenever enticed
Prada, blue leather, whatever her vice is

Float like Muhammad Ali (Yeah)
Wave, I was born in a sea (Wave)
Life of the party (Life of the party)
Miami, we had to star it (We had to star it)
I feed her, we eatin' calamari
Drip on these suckers, sorry, I'm not sorry
Order the PJ, I'm flyin' to Maui
One of one, only get VLONE from Bari (VLONE from Bari)
She came with me once, had a wonderful day
Bitch wrote a book and put me in her diary
We fucked on a boat, I'm a pirate (Pirate)
Admit it, I know you admire it (Admire it)
My diamonds dance like parade (Parade)
Matte black Aventador, same color shades (Shade)
Earn your promotion, I'll give you a raise (Raise)

Tropical bitches, her hair wet and wavy
Put a big double M on my Mercedes
Got me some millions, no minimum wagin'

A mountain, ooh, ooh
Too toxic (Toxic), ooh, ooh
Wavy, not vibin' (Vibin'), ooh, ooh

Top floor (Yeah)
Elevator entrance, not doors
Only thing above us is outdoors
Took her down to Houston to the chachos
Took a million and started a bank
Top of the floor, man, it came with the rank
And you're welcome come party, the hell did you think?
Juggle the beats how I juggle the fame
And I gobble the pain when I swallow this drank
I grow my own gas in the back of the farm
Need the cover of Time so my haters believers
I ran through these seasons with centerfold pieces
Flip the promoter just like we do pizza
Just run me my cheese, we don't wanna go grease ya
Hotline (Okay), turn the pipeline to a lifeline

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
A mountain, ooh, ooh
Too toxic (Toxic), ooh, ooh
Wavy, not vibin' (Vibin'), ooh, ooh

MET GALA Lyrics[Intro]
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
I drip on this bitch like Met Gala, ballin'
Answer her texts, don't answer her calls

[Chorus]
Yeah, she sent me a text, won't answer her call
She love when I flex and shop in the mall
Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls
We speed in that 'Vette, don't stop for the laws
VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip, that Met Gala Ball

[Verse 1]
Shoot your shit up, I got accurate aim
Fucked up a few mil', now I'm back like I came
That boy say my name, I went and got me some strain
You know I don't crash, I just stay in my lane
Please don't compare, because we not the same
GunWun ain't no gimmick, ain't clownin' for fame
I trapped for a living and been had a name
Work hard for these clothes, cars, and watches and chains
Oh, man, Rolls-Royce got umbrellas, this whip for the rain
These folks done fucked up, let me slip in the game
This bitch let me fuck, this shit went to her brain
She know I'm a beast, and ain't easy to tame
She squirt on my sheets while I beat out her frame
Dozed off, woke back up, she still sayin' my name
In love with my life, and you wish we could trade
[Chorus]
Yeah, she sent me a text, won't answer her call
She love when I flex and shop in the mall
Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls
We speed in that 'Vette, don't stop for the laws
VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip, that Met Gala Ball

[Verse 2]
Walk in with the drip like Met Gala Ball
Came in and she strip, her panties and all
Lip gloss on her lip, suck me like a Hall
A boss and a pimp, I bought me a ship
I walk with a limp, FN in my drawers
When she talk that shit, I put dick in her jaws
I hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Came from Flat Shoals and Old Nat
On the South, in that back, you get whacked, then get shot in your car
Why hell you think that I'm maxin'? Relaxin' in mansions, no cappin', 'cause we had it hard
I ain't get this shit just from askin', I made this shit happen and passion, it played a big part
I ain't get this bitch off of mackin', it came off of actions and fashion and stay in accord

[Chorus]
Yeah, she sent me a text, won't answer her call
She love when I flex and shop in the mall
Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls
We speed in that 'Vette, don't stop for the laws
VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip, that Met Gala Ball14Embed
