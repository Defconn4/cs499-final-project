Kung Fu Lyrics[Intro]
Day-Day-Daytrip took it to 10

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil' ho, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans

[Post-Chorus]
Ayy, hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (Ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat (Ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell momma I'ma quit but I love cash
[Verse 1]
I'ma just get it and get it again
Come ups I split with my friends, ayy
Twenty's them twenty's them twinny twin twin
Tryna flip Ford to a Benz
I'ma get it, I'ma get it regardless
Bussin juugs, I used to trap out the college
Give me brain, I swear that bitch is a scholar
No snakes around me, only snake on my collar
I'm a thief in the night, pray to Jesus, to Christ
Better hope he believe in your life
Free my lil' nigga Saudi, was catching them bodies
He fighting his demons to light
All my niggas be trapping, your niggas be rapping
They robbed you, you asking what happened
Got a new bitch from China, she wearing designer
I'm lacing her in the new fashion, ayy

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil' ho, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans
[Post-Chorus]
Ayy, hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (Ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat (Ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell momma I'ma quit but I love cash

[Verse 2]
Ayy, I've been all around the fucking globe
Baby what ya know?
Motherfucker better tuck and roll, got places to go
And niggas missed the last flight, livin' in the fast life
Momma said, "You never act right, goddamn"
Guess I'm a bad guy, but I'm on my grind like a halfpipe
'Cause I switch it and flip it and cook it up mad nice
'Til I see them flashlights, then I'm gone
Fast flash like, my future's a tad bright
Because when they rent is due, and your Benz is new
And your old friends be resenting you
Like my women brown, and my Benjis blue
Shit is fucked up, when they envy you
'Member niggas got killed over Penny shoes
Where I'm from niggas dying like Kenny do
Take a hit of this PAC and this Henny juice
Only one of me, but there's plenty you
It was all a dream, reminiscing over smaller things
Grandma cooking like Paula Deen
It ain't all it seems, grew up with the starving teens
And growing plants, still watering (ahh)
[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil' ho, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans

[Post-Chorus]
Ayy, hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (Ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat (Ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell Momma I'ma quit but I love cash

RNP Lyrics[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
One of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Ooh, not one of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
Uh, okay, put your fucking hands up, this the fucking anthem
Smiling 'cause I'm young, rich, black, and I'm handsome
Not to mention wealthy, ass on her healthy
Young millionaire, what the fuck can you tell me? Smell me?
Nigga, that's Chanel cologne
I'm in Europe with the tourists with no cellular phone
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Like ooh, sound like rich nigga problems
I hit a bad bitch with a fistful of condoms
And the randomness of risky ménages
Like get the head right, she can get what she wanted
The spits, then flaunt it, my drip like a faucet
She told me she was prego, I ain't even take the motherfuckin' dick out my pocket, yeah

[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]
The opposite
She want me to fly her, so I copped a jet
Must be thinkin' I'm a one way ticket on a runway
Drippin' in my feng shui, sippin' on a sundae

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
One of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Ooh, not one of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 4: YBN Cordae & Anderson .Paak]
I bought a Moncler coat for the times we were broke
I'ma wear it in the summer on LeBron James boat
Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats
Ayy, we like a cold team, nigga, Shaq and Kobe
Like back in '03, I was only like 6
Shit, I was like 16, but I can give a sixteen
I can make a bitch scream, that's a bit extreme
I got a thick bald bitch, I call her Ms. Clean
My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine
We all all-stars, you hardly sixth string
Yeah, I had to ball hard to harvest these dreams
Swear to God, me too, no Harvey Weinstein
The coupe was lime green, my wrist was blinding
We party in South Beach, Ferraris and blue cheese
Fuck does that even mean? Nigga, just let the hook sing
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
One of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Ooh, not one of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me48Embed

Bad Idea Lyrics[Intro: YBN Cordae]
Ooh
Ooh
Yeah, uh
(Bongo ByTheWay)

[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
I know myself all too well to be a stranger of pain
Despite it all, we remainin' the same, I'm just changin' the game
Heart pure, never tainted with fame
Straight ahead, I'ma stay in my lane
Never switchin' courses, life's amazin', shit is gorgeous
Lookin' at the bigger picture, portrait, and I smile wide
Performed the song and the crowd cried
How can I lie? I'm tearin' up as I'm startin' to stare in y'all eyes
I know the shit you goin' through the last month
You stressin' as you hittin' on that glass blunt
A nigga prayin' to get lucky like Daft Punk
You can't even stomach the pain, now that's a bad lunch
Uh, ramen noodles on the regular
Add some seasoning and some hot sauce for a better touch
Peanut butter, jelly and syrup sandwich, etcetera
And we just flyin' in the nebula
[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it'll be alright

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I done been around the world four times, lookin' for parkin'
Finally found a condo, that shit still feel like apartment
Out South, my foul mouth started soundin' like Cartman
Roundabout like cartwheels, hopped inside of a U-Haul
Confused where all my art went, monsters in a quiet place
Some of these decisions is like Sharpie on a dry-erase
I know they thought I wouldn't, but I'm a fireplace
I had my cake and ate it too, that shit is an acquired taste
I promised I would buy a place, I got my favorite roommates
They used to never see me, like when you zip up a new Bape
Do that shit 'fore it's too late, don't ever drink the Kool-Aid
Don't ever think it's sweet, that's that crème de la brûlée
Who they? They Robert Goulet, they Nazi, cuckoo, goofy
My wifey yellin', "Who they?" My daughter yellin', "Hooray"
I see it clear like Blu-Ray, I park it in the sky
I keep 'em on my block, 'round the corner of my eye
Like a stye (Uh)
[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]
So don't you shed a tear
'Cause there'll be better years
I live life by faith, nigga, instead of fear
God cryin', thunderstorms is Heaven tears
The feelin' of lost hope, shit is never here
'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means
A young nigga, dawg, but I done witnessed many things
Age 13, wearin' hand-me-down skinny jeans
You know they a little extra faded around the knees
With the grass stains in 'em
I really wish a little extra cash came in 'em, 'cause a nigga really needed it
Pain, I defeated it, and brought back
Soul survivor, nigga, what you call that?

[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it's gon' be alright
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright18Embed

Have Mercy Lyrics[Intro]
Kid
Ugh

[Chorus]
Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware
I don't know where I'm goin', huh
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back
[Verse 1]
There's no complainin' on this side
My niggas, shit is not tolerated
Cut some niggas off like a operation
And my team way more consolidated
Suite presidential, that's inauguration
'Cause we cookin' crack like Ronald Reagan
Chip on my shoulder, boy, I'm not for waitin'
Divine timin', took a lot of patience
Now it's time for the takeover, all gas and the brake's slower
Took a trip out to Tokyo, now I'm here in Paris for the layover
Fuck old niggas, boy, your day's over
You mad at me because your pace slower
Bitter nigga, you a shade-thrower, I was just sleepin' on Ace sofa
Now I ride with a paid chauffeur
'Cause I'm way doper, better stay sober
I paint pictures, you a Crayola
I got a bad bitch and she laid over
She really asked could she stay over
I told her that we need to face closure
The smell of money has a great odor
These the things that I prayed over

[Chorus]
Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware
I don't know where I'm goin', huh
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back (Huh, huh)
[Verse 2]
Why cry over spilled milk if you still feel I'm the real deal?
My bitch bad with no ill-will 'cause she'll murk a nigga like Kill Bill
Loose lips sink ships, Cam'ron pink drip, that is my fashion
I'm not really with the high flashin', it's no helpin' with my braggin'
I penetrate it, been the greatest
New house, renovate it
I got the juice, you eliminated
Pussy niggas always instigatin'
Can't fuck me over, boy, I'm too clever
That applies all to whoever
I'm just here to pursue pleasure
Boy, I'm goin' out like Hugh Hefner

[Chorus]
Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware
I don't know where I'm goin', huh
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back

Baby Jesus, please save us

Old Niggas Lyrics[Intro]
Damn, Mizzy Mauri got beats

[Verse]
Uh, old niggas and new niggas, now what's the difference?
All in the same boat in a stuck position
So when an old nigga talkin' I don't fuckin' listen
They don't know, every day we make tough decisions
It seems though we is at a generational gap
Which bring conversation and a statement in fact
We can agree, none of us is 'posed to make it in rap
I understand both sides, let me break it in half
Let's take it back: when hip hop originated
And old niggas said it was wack, they couldn't take it
And called it a lil' trend, said it wouldn't last
Now, it's the number one genre as the time passed
Young niggas won't listen and we know it, ha
But old niggas always talk and never show it, uh
You gotta practice what you preach and the classes that you teach
We'll eventually listen, my mind mentally prison, uh
Lately, all my idols, they been failin' me
Catchin' sexual assaults and some felonies
Then, you want me to listen what you tellin' me
And wanna hate when we sing our lil' melodies
And other idols, they be broke, get your funds in order
And Kanye West is a Trump supporter
Then, we got R. Kelly and Bill Cosby
Who still probably got lil' girls in the Hills lobby
And these supposed to be our heroes? Negro, please
Old niggas unreliable like D-Rose knees
Only man I can trust is G-O-D
Not to mention Mos Def and Talib Kweli
Now I get it, y'all think new niggas really suck
And white kids fuckin' love it, lil' silly ducks
But I know it's a lot of bullshit goin' on
I understand, but please, don't complain without a plan
Ironically I wrote this whole song off a xan, nah I'm playin'
I'm just tryna be a fuckin' man
We see you old niggas as a lot of clowns
Not to mention, our father figures was not around
So we all on tours and we hoppin' towns
We just need to sit down and find common ground
And it's soon to come, soon to come
Hip-hop need balance like the moon and sun
It feel good when I wear Christian Louboutins
So I gotta drop music to accrue some funds
And I get it, that's the mindset that's killin' the rhyme-fest
But feedin' our families, lowering the crime, yet
You want us to be separate and make a contest
Rappin' to stay up out the streets, shouldn't mind that
Stayin' out of prison and we sayin' fuck the system, man
Rappin' is an outlet to go and get our dividends
Rather than out robbin' niggas, sellin' Ritalin
Old niggas bitter, y'all should love it when a nigga win
'Cause we came from the same struggle
Like Diddy and Dame Russell
Was teachin' and gained hustle, got rich, remained subtle
See, I listen, see, I listen
But Lil Dae-Dae water-whippin' in the kitchen
Ready to flip a pack and bring it back, no submission
Gotta just go attack Lil Pump when you're dissin'
I understand both sides of the Ziploc
Y'all old niggas' time is comin', nigga, tick-tock
I'ma still wear all my Gucci flip-flops
And the fuckin' diamond chain with the big rocks
And I'll be the greatest ever, nigga, just watch
Cardi B got rich from Love & Hip Hop, haha32Embed

Alaska Lyrics[Intro]
Maddox on the beat
M.W.A. Music
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position

[Verse 1]
The game is over, my pain is over, you a lame, a joker
You can't catch me plus my flow is nasty and my name is vulgar
YBN, go and try again, we be the flyest friends
I do my thing, plus I pull some strings just like a violin
Let me tell you 'bout my life and my troubled past
Momma's car got stolen, took the shuttle pass
Re-up from three bucks copped the duffle bag
Please bruh, off these nuts, go and rush some cash
And now we winning again, my brothers spending a band
My niggas posted on the block, damn I be sinning with friends
I'm chasing twenties, Benjamins, and breaking barriers too
My family rich for generations, I might marry a Jew (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position, uh

[Verse 2]
My lifestyle too wild, I know
Everything change with a new high low
Fifty bands, what I cashed in, my show
I got that gas, this that hydro
I'm too great, I don't have rivals
Niggas be telling speed dial 5-0
Cause these niggas be fake, I'm a winner these days
Motherfuckers be sweet, with a hint of cheesecake
Syrup spilling, coughin' penicillin
Heads turning walking in the building
Ledge burnin' often I'm a villain
Was deserted, brought up by some real ones
Had to catch it reckless, was a daily
Momma calling checking on her baby
Took a trip to Texas going crazy
Eating beats for breakfast, I'm elated
I was stressing, blessings on the way
Dropped out, no testing me today
Murder tracks, I bet I beat the case
Redbone, she built like LisaRaye
Stack my chips I bought my Frito Lay
I don't listen what these people say
Fuck a Honda, niggas need a Wraith
Damn the whole team eating great
[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster, ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position (ah)23Embed

Broke As Fuck Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Chorus]
I was broke as fuck‚ down up on my ass‚ had the lowest luck
Used to ride the bike up to the store‚ I need a Rover truck
A Bentley coupe, yeah, I'm wearin' Prada‚ I like Fendi too
Grandma passed, had a heart attack, only 62
My cousin shot‚ got me paranoid, who to trust or not
Gave my brother 25 years, that really sucked a lot
Post-traumatic stress is building up, you niggas so dramatic
Fuck these other niggas, I'm the illest, I'm the coldest at it (Yeah, uh)

[Verse 1]
Let me take you niggas back to a much simpler time
Picture yourself inside a vehicle, a ship in my mind
You'll see some childhood memories mixed with the cells of a don
You'll see the doctor smack my ass when I first fell out my mom
A Magic School Bus adventure trip inside my cerebral
Back when I told niggas I'll make it, swear they didn't believe him
Flashback to Brasstracks and we was playin' "No Problems"
We was crankin' all the classics from the spring to the autumn
And I said motherfuck, need a bad bitch with a tummy tuck
How I make a million from a dollar? It was dummy luck
Need a new Lam', no sedan, fuck a Hummer truck
I'm aiming for the top, I'm steady climbing, fuck a runner-up
[Chorus]
I was broke as fuck, down up on my ass, had the lowest luck
Used to ride the bike up to the store, I need a Rover truck
A Bentley coupe, yeah, I'm wearin' Prada, I like Fendi too
Grandma passed, had a heart attack, only 62
My cousin shot, got me paranoid, who to trust or not
Gave my brother 25 years, that really sucked a lot
Post-traumatic stress is building up, you niggas so dramatic
Fuck these other niggas, I'm the illest, I'm the coldest at it, ayy

[Interlude]
Uh-huh
(Hey)
Yeah
Woo
Uh, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
Mom and dad never had a damn thing, damn shame
Now I'm poppin' champagne on a private jet, fuck an airplane
Order Bossa Nova, eating plantains
Presidential Rollie, fuck a campaign
Impeach, nigga, ten deep, nigga
Remember days we was wearin' J's
And a gold chain, only had three figures
So fortunate, proportionate
Lost Boy, nigga, no coordinates
Remember Christmas? We was giftless
Three foot tree, no ornaments
Pull my dick out, hoes swarmin' it
Flow cold, nigga, no warmin' it
Mama couldn't afford AAU
So we couldn't hoop, nigga, no tournaments
I remember days sippin' lemonade
Ice cream truck gettin' plenty paid
Candy lady had Jolly Ranchers
I don't really have a lot of answers
I'm just searching for the same shit
Same niggas that I came with
Premonitions over reminiscing
Lam' truck how I lane switch (Ah)37Embed

Parables (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Cordae]
Gotta ride with 'em, ride with 'em
Ride with 'em, roll with the, whoa, whoa, whoa
Tell 'em, "Ride with 'em," we could ride with 'em
Ride with 'em, whoa, we could, whoa, whoa, whoa
I tell the odd, gotcha, odd, getcha, woo, what
Check it out, nigga, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Nigga, I need, we could fight with 'em, ride
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Cordae]
Done seen some shit within my lifetime, my light shine bright
Protect yo' energy from poison when the python strike
My first mistake was doin' robberies on Niken bikes
Watch my movеs and I'ma show you what a icon like
Y'all let bygones bе bygones, right?
Nigga, fuck yo' truce, bust yo' move
And if that nigga touch your shoes
You better blast on 'em and on my mama, nigga
I'ma get that cash on 'em, hunnid on the dash on 'em
Swerve, born from the trench, you from the 'burbs
Nigga, fuck the early bird, nigga
I'ma get this motherfuckin' chicken
And if a nigga ever got a problem, nigga
We can fuckin' solve it, on my mama, nigga
I just been itchin' to prove myself
I just pray throughout the struggle I don't lose myself
Glock, no safety, Plaxico, I might shoot myself
They catchin' bullets like two Odells, and, nigga, you gon' tell
But listen
[Chorus: Cordae]
I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit that other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga

[Verse 2: Cordae]
First and foremost, for every door that's opened, a door close
Beat a nigga, take his Bordeauxs, upgrade my wardrobe
And Lord knows livin' like this, it leads a short road
A dead end, or prison time, where we was headin'
Instead, when I got bread, broke it with brethren
Eyes open, leave the house, move like a veteran
Made a couple dollars from come-ups, my niggas flexin'
Nigga got a problem, then I can make some corrections
Okay, cool, still with the same niggas since grade school
Give a fuck about your Shade Room when I had made room
For everybody on that late moon, and word to Rae Sremm'
Had to bring the motherfuckin' swang on 'em
And I ain't even wanna have to blank on 'em
That Lam' truck got a full tank on 'em
But, a nigga better not look at me wrong
It's certain shit that I can't say on this song, but let me tell you, nigga
[Chorus: Cordae & Eminem]
I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit that other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan (Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I done seen some shit within my lifetime, at one time I
Can still remember just how bad I used to want '5 mics'
My biggest dream was just to make it into Unsigned Hype
It's so hard for me to fathom this was once my life
Shit'll make you wanna cop out like a plea deal
So I treat a beat like it's Tekashi, spit on that bitch like Meek Mill
My addiction got me weak-willed
I'm relapsing, I think I can't seem to stop eating Beat Pills
And Doctor D-R-E he still keeps on giving me refills
Send 'em at me, bullets hit indiscriminately
Women and men and little kids senior citizens till the Sig is empty
Whipped Gen-Z into a frenzy, but no give, is in me, I'm stingy
And that is the motherfuckin' difference between them and me
And that's the reason I'm, in my Louis Vuitton
Gorier than Eva Long
This rap shit, is somethin' that you'll never see me at, like senior prom
What I mean's the bar's, higher than Cheech and Chong
When you give them each a bong
I call my Stan's a, fan club 'cause whoever it's unleashed upon
Fuckin' beats up on, like police batons
Y'all are window shoppers, bunch a Peeping Toms
Still got that bullseye on my back, red dot on my head
Yeah, blood on my hands for some of the rhymes that I've said
Police squad on the task
Got 'em hot on my trail, like my stepfather with the belt, I got S.W.A.T on my ass
I was painfully shy, now I'm proud of myself
Like Obama's kids, I came outta my shell (Michelle)
And I can promise this
On my mama, shit, no daughters, bitch
That every single word'll be true so with out further adieu
It's return of the ruthless more murderous than Mook is so what you're gonna do's think I'm allergic when I point this motherfuckin burner at 'chu
I throw shade it'll be curtains for you
Pray for the verse to get through, birth of a new
Worser me who's determined to do
Permanent damage with the words that I threw, bird's-eye view I'm referred to as Zeus
Circlin' you like I'm a vulture features are tournaments, I turn 'em into
Turning me loose is like verbal abuse, language hurtful to use cursin' at you
Made a couple of mistakes that occurred in my youth, jumped a hurdle or two word but I'm through
With tellin' you about the food stamps and the government cheese
And how we used to get school lunches for free
Already told ya, 'bout the holes up in my Pony shoes and Rustler jeans
When it was Mother, lil' brother and me
I told you 'bout, being kicked out 20 degrees, no money to eat
'Bout the thrift stores and being piss poor, the Christmases Ma had gifts for us, when bro and me discovered that she
Was wrappin' shit up around the house, to stick it under the tree

Super Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo, woo)
Huh, huh

[Chorus]
Last year, I made seven million
Didn't have to do a single fuckin' show
Shout out to my niggas up at Coca-Cola
For the check they cut me at the Super Bowl
All my life moments is a super woah
My nigga Dr. Dre, he got a super boat
Last night, I was textin' Jack Dorsey
That's the perks you get from being super dope

[Verse 1]
This is real life, ain't no actin' it
All these rap niggas, they be Brad Pittin' (Uh)
Every little thing I do is mad different (Yeah)
Got my lil' cousin playin' badminton (Yeah)
Gave my lil' bro a quick fifty piеce
He got the wholе motherfuckin' trap hittin'
I been stackin' up all these assets
Can't be conductin' any bad business (Nah)
Like woah, hey, I keep that drip on me
My nigga, I'm big homie (Big homie)
Huh, hey, I can't ever slip homie
My mama might flip on me (Might flip on me)
Like woah, hey, drop-top coupe in the motherfuckin' summer
I rest my case (Rest my case)
Like huh, hey, I'ma live life to the fullest
With every single breath I take, uh-huh (Every breath I take)
Let me tell you lil' niggas something real quick (Uh)
Hatin'-ass ho, you can suck my dick (Suck it)
Get cold every time that you touch my wrist
I'm the greatest, nigga, you can't fuck with this (Nah)
My niggas pull up in them Chevys and Beamers
We all young and rich, you can't check my demeanor
I just bought a Birkin for my aunt Regina
I been getting money since I was a senior, but (Woo)
[Chorus]
Last year, I made seven million
Didn't have to do a single fuckin' show
Shout out to my niggas up at Coca-Cola

Last night, I was textin' Jack Dorsey
That's the perks you get from being super dope

[Verse 2]
I be feeling like it's me against the world
But I can give a fuck who my opponent is (Nah)
Niggas askin' why I dropped the YBN
I had no other choice 'cause we ain't own this shit (Real)
You know that janky shit, I'm not condoning it (Nah)
I'm with a couple niggas, I got a bone to pick (Real)
I'm on some movement shit, y'all on some moment shit (Huh)
But I'll be here forever, y'all can go and quit
We had bad bitches in a new Bentley
Just re-upped from that new stimmy
My brother countin' them blue Benjis
Only feel good when my crew with me, like woah
They tried to question my character
Young, rich, and Black, they hate me in America
We some real niggas, don't fit the criteria
Don't like your vibe, not allowed in my area
I entered this game and I came here to change it
Speak my beliefs, now they calling me dangerous
Takin' the throne and I'm gonna maintain it
I gotta go down as just one of the greatest (Huh)
So anybody got a problem with me
Can't fake kick it, fuck your politicking (Fuck)
I ain't worried 'bout it, I know God is with me (Amen)
And your piece of mind is worth a dollar fifty, but (Lord)
[Chorus]
Last year, I made seven million
Didn't have to do a single fuckin' show
Shout out to my niggas up at Coca-Cola

Last night, I was textin' Jack Dorsey
That's the perks you get from being super dope

Gifted Lyrics[Pre-Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Livin' out my dream, my life is different (Different)
If I want it, then I'ma get it (Get it)
Living every day like it was Christmas
'Cause I'm gifted (Ah, ah, ah)
And I know what my gift is (Ah, ah, ah)
And I know that I'm gifted (Ah, ah, ah)
And I know what my gift is (Ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus: Cordae & Roddy Ricch]
Uh, I got a whole lotta people that's been countin' on me
Got this bad lil' shawty goin' down on the D
I met shorty and we connected like the WiFi
Hopped in the Phantom, disappeared like, "Voilà"
I told niggas that I would make it, they said, "No way"
Watch them niggas that might eat up off of your plate
They caught me slidin' on the E-Way with the hеat on the seat
I got tennis chains with crossеs but I still keep a piece
[Verse: Cordae & Roddy Ricch]
See, I was twelve years with the Tommy fit
Fifteen, crankin' "Bobby Bitch"
I was seventeen years on this Earth
When I popped a Perc', made my body itch
Need a pound of blow when I'm drownin' slow
I was down below, word to Roddy Ricch
We was slap-boxin', no Karate Kid
Start to see the difference with a lotta shit
And my grandma got a lotta kids
Bought whips foreign, no mileages
Hit Saks Fifth and got a Prada fit
But I still got a lotta wallet
Shit, nigga, this the shit that I asked for
'Member last year I was mad poor
Seen my momma cry over homicides
Now she down to fly, she got a passport
And my brother locked for a backdoor
Got my grandmomma a new Jaguar
Big body whips like Shaq car
No credit check, straight Cash Card
Nigga, no stress, I progress
That's Mos Def like Black Star
Seen the future in my Audemars
Stack paper, don't do no facade
[Chorus: Cordae & Roddy Ricch]
Uh, I got a whole lotta people that's been countin' on me
Got this bad lil' shawty goin' down on the D
I met shorty and we connected like the WiFi
Hopped in the Phantom, disappeared like, "Voilà"
I told niggas that I would make it, they said, "No way"
Watch them niggas that might eat up off of your plate
They caught me slidin' on the E-Way with the heat on the seat
I got tennis chains with crosses but I still keep a piece

Livin' out my dream, my life is different (Different)
If I want it, then I'ma get it (Get it)

And I know what my gift is (Ah, ah, ah)
And I know that I'm gifted (Ah, ah, ah)

Lost & Found Lyrics[Intro]
Switch up my lifestyle
Yup, yup, uh, huh

[Verse]
Yeah, I was a lost boy, now I'm found
Niggas switched up, they can't come around
See these rap niggas biting my sound
Shout out my bitch for holdin' it down
I had to switch up my lifestyle
If she bad, I'ma go and fuck her lights out
Mama always told me I was a bright child
Naked pictures saved on my iCloud
My goodness, my God, my gracious
Got a bad little bitch, my favorite
And I eat the pussy like it's caviar
Nigga, I ain't talkin' 'bout that playlist
Most necessary, cold February
Flow never buried, shit is everlastin'
Opportunity is never passin'
Was just in school skippin' hella classes
New whip, hit the pedal thrashin'
Grew up where I heard the metal blastin'
I know that greed is the devil's passion
He wears Prada and stiletto fashion
Gucci has become the ghetto fashion
I am just another rebel rappin'
But that studio time led to Louis Vuitton
That I just bought for my mom
Celebration, mix Ciroc and a lime
Rest in peace X, the Pac of his time
Was manifested, can't stop the divine
The nigga speakin' like Barack in his prime
But I'm Bill Clinton with these ill writtens, make the real listen
Seen Monica Lewinsky in the Hills drippin'
Hours later, call me Mike Jones 'cause I'm still tippin'
Call up Scotty with the shotty, 'cause I feel Pippen
I'm a real fresh prince, Uncle Phil, listen
And tell Will Smith how I kill shit
And to please adopt a young nigga
Man, I'm tryna get real rich
Nah I'm playin', shout out to Jaden
So iconic how I go Super Saiyan
New bitch foreign, straight from the Himalayans
On top soon, Lord knows I been prayin'
'Cause I'm on my grind, watch how I kickflip
Money notorious, I'm buyin' big shit
God is so glorious, bless me with riches
I was just broke, now I'm a rich kid
Gas what I smoke, that shit is vicious
Give me that throat, say it's delicious
Rappers is jokes, I'm a musician
Rappers is jokes, I'm a musician, huh
None of these niggas want smoke with me
So hopefully my flow will breed
Some rappers with actual potency
Spit hot lava, erode the beat, my God
[Outro]
What you think of that, Bren?9Embed

My Name Is Lyrics[Intro]
Wooh!
Alright, alright
Now listen, listen loud and clear, you dig?
This is uh, this is history
For real nigga
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
Now check me out, listen

[Verse 1]
Why everybody change on me?
While I remain the same, that's why I'm bringing Major Payne
Like mothafuckin' Damon Wayans
And now you chickens is toast, this ain't Raising Cane's
It's clear we wasn't raised the same, rappers lame with fame
I'm known to kill a wack rapper like a bad hobby
I smash hotties and stash bodies, then cop lil' boats
Like that's Yachty, and that's probably
Why I'm so fly that I crash lobbies and after it slap thotties
I'm a rap fanatic who rap fantastic without the platinum status
Why I'm blastin' the maddest 'cause most of these cats is average (uh)
I swear to God that I never lie to avoid a fact
A terrible hair stylist, I'm destroying tracks
I don’t bust guns but my niggas deploy the strap
Then bring out a fucking .45 like Michael Jordan's back
I wanna give these niggas hell if heaven was grant
The best thing from PG since Kevin Durant
[Hook]
Hah, my name is, my name is, yeah
Oh yeah, YBN shit
Don't doubt my name, I said, I tell 'em what my name
Nigga better know the name, yeah, YBN shit
Better know, my name is (yuh)

[Verse 2]
See, a nigga was skippin' class, damn I rather attempt the raps
Said fuck it I'm missing that, when I blow go tick for tack
I'm a boss on my Diddy shit, my flow is too hideous
Dropped out of school, senior year, a true idiot
You see, I wear designer bags, I don't carry minor cash
I'm trying to find the stack, big as Blac Chyna's ass
Oh you wack rhymers, trash climbers, that's kinda sad
In the pathfinder, but my path couldn't find my dad
Now my soul dented, pulled up in a Ghost tinted
In a drive-by, where niggas shooting shit like Cole Bennett
You ho's finished, in this rap shit a cold menace
But I'm flowin' gold liquid, damn I'm so vicious
Uh, my name is Cordae, but don't forget the YBN
I used to get high with friends off grandmama's vicodins
And mix it with a percocet, damn that really worked a sweat
My verse is just perfect, yeah, fuck it go and search the net

[Hook]
Hah, my name is, my name is
Nigga's be the lamest, YBN shit
My name, you nigga's know his name
The nigga's flow is lame, nigga, hah
Man, these niggas whack as fuck
In this music shit, bro, like what the fuck
You niggas suck like shit bro, like
Damn you niggas fucking suck. man3Embed

Wintertime Lyrics[Verse 1]
Uh, okay, we all got skeletons in our closet from a shady past
Made me brag about my Mercedes, Jag
Going fast, made me crash
My ex keep fuckin' up my car with her crazy ass
Lately, sad
Reminisce the times, please take me back
Aimin' for the top, I'm on target like a Brady pass
Did a show for eighty cash, and threw it in my lady bag
That was fuckin' easy money, sniper, on my KD swag
Thought about quittin', I'm a warrior, can take the jab
Whoever said shit was easy forever lied
I mesmerize, how simple decisions can jeopardize
When Martin Luther cheated and stared in Coretta's eyes
This is lyrical exercise, told my idols to step aside
My mama said I'm buggin', no need for the pesticides
Was just waitin' tables, gave customers extra fries
Maya Angelou with accounts, I just let it rise
And hopefully my words never die
[Chorus]
Wintertime and it's rainin'
But shit, I don't be complainin'
Summer's cold, shit is dangerous
Yeah, I can feel the changes (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Try to take a walk up in my shoes
A nigga rappin' like I really got somethin' to prove
'Cause motherfucker, I do
I climb hills, niggas was sleepin', on Nyquil
Paint a picture vivid, dawg, on everything, my life's real
Was just in college, strugglin' to get a nice meal
Made it out the gutter, then that's all because of my skills
All because the glory, nigga, let me tell my story
I am not that nigga with potential, I am not a worry
I was lost like Dory, but I'm finally found
Was addicted to the Xans to calm anxiety down
And I never would admit because society clowns
Any nigga with a problem, they can't quiet me now, nigga

[Chorus]
Wintertime and it's rainin'
But shit, I don't be complainin'
Summer's cold, shit is dangerous
Yeah, I can feel the changes
[Outro]
Know where you come from, it's easy to tell where you going
Yeah
Just keep dreaming 'til you find out7Embed

We Gon Make It Lyrics[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, God bless the dreamchasers
If you got a dream, keep chasin' it
Never let nobody here trap your dreams
You gon' make it, yeah

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I could've died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like, "Wait a minute'"
She know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it
[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
See I know how it feels on the late nights, swimmin' with the great whites
Drownin' in the deep waters, know you got three daughters
Could use some resources, nah, we just need order
I got my own bad news, fuck a reporter
Niggas ain't even safe, they wanna deport us
Or rather keep us boxed in on the street corners
If you gon' stop and frisk a nigga, shit, at least warn us
My dawg still on probation, they got a leash on us
Far from stupid, in fact, I'm smarter than Harvard students
Sparked a movement and put an end to this garbage music
Got me thinkin' like this can't be life
These stupid ass niggas voted for the Antichrist

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I could've died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like, "Wait a minute'"
She know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it, yeah

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
It was hell here, my people killin' and it's 12 here
Got my mom a Black Card and she was just on welfare, that's goals
Did it on my own, I got myself here
When God asked me do I want this shit? I said, "Hell yeah"
I'm ready, when I put the crown on, it was heavy
I was drownin' in my past like when Katrina broke the levees in New Orleans
In my city, to them kids, I'm like Jordan
Every move I make like chess, it's important
I just went against the system, spending nights tryna reform it
Lay at night thinkin' I could lose my life just from doin' this
It's a sacrifice, I know it wouldn't be right if I forfeit
But I do it for the young kings that never had no voices, for real
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I could've died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like, "Wait a minute'"
She know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it

[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]
Yeah, okay, I reminisce the cold days in wintertime, got home by dinner time
7-Eleven runs, Gatorade flavor lemon-lime
Hot Cheetos, Arizonas, oranges, clementine
The first job I ever applied for was Finish Line
Sometimes a nigga be forgettin', then remember I'm
Savior of the rap shit, the leader of the renaissance
Self-appointed, well anointed for my endeavors
I'm eyein' cheddar, applyin' pressure, defyin' set-ups
The rap game is based upon what niggas lyin' better
If truth is told, then you can grow and dyin' never
No, I'm everlastin', better graspin' this thing in life
I heard Meek hook and I told him to sing it twice, my God

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I could've died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like, "Wait a minute'"
She know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it11Embed

The Parables Lyrics[Intro]
Gotta ride with 'em, ride with 'em
Ride with 'em, roll with the, woah, woah, woah
Tell 'em, "Ride with 'em," we could ride with 'em
Ride with 'em, woah, we could, woah, woah, woah
I tell the odd, gotcha, odd, getcha, woo, what
Check it out, nigga, woah, woah, woah, woah
Nigga, we could fight with 'em, ride
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Done seen some shit within my lifetime, my light shine bright
Protect your energy from poison when the python strike
My first mistake was doin' robberies on Niken bikes
Watch my moves and I'ma show you what a icon like
Y'all let bygones be bygones, right?
Nigga, fuck your truce, bust your move
And if that nigga touch your shoes
You better blast on 'em and on my mama, nigga
I'ma get that cash on 'em, hunnid on the dash on 'em
Swerve, born from the trench, you from the 'burbs
Nigga, fuck the early bird, nigga
I'ma get this motherfuckin' chicken
And if a nigga ever got a problem, nigga
We can fuckin' solve it, on my mama, nigga
I just been itchin' to prove myself
I just pray throughout the struggle I don't lose myself
Glock, no safety, Plaxico, I might shoot myself
They catchin' bullets like two Odells, and, nigga, you gon' tell
But listen
[Chorus]
I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit the other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you by the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga

[Verse 2]
First and foremost, for every door that's opened, a door close
Beat a nigga, take his Bordeauxs, upgrade my wardrobe
And Lord knows livin' like this, it leads a short road
A dead end, or prison time, where we was headin'
Instead, when I got bread, broke it with brethren
Eyes open, leave the house, move like a veteran
Made a couple dollars from come-ups, my niggas flexin'
Nigga got a problem, then I can make some corrections
Okay, cool, still with the same niggas since grade school
Give a fuck about your Shade Room when I had made room
For everybody on that late moon, and word to Rae Sremm'
Had to bring the motherfuckin' swang on 'em
And I ain't even wanna have to blank on 'em
That Lam' truck got a full tank on 'em
But, a nigga better not look at me wrong
It's certain shit that I can't say on this song, but let me tell you, nigga
[Chorus]
I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit the other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you by the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga21Embed

Nightmares Are Real Lyrics[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
Okay, uh, I can tell you how I first started in this rap shit
Mama kicked a nigga out the house, felt fantastic
Told my homies, "If you got a couch, know I'm crashin'
Worried 'bout my future, couldn't care about the past tense
Lost my grandmother, and I haven't been the same since
Start to get anxious, I'm tired of this lame shit
Tired of the struggle, livin' family in the subdivision
Ramen noodles, drawin' doodles wasn't in my fuckin' vision
But who's fault is that? Tryna stay all intact
Fightin' all my demons, they be schemin' but I'm crawlin' back
And eventually flyin', lately been mentally cryin'
Niggas resentin' me, I am not for the industry lyin'

[Chorus: YBN Cordae & Pusha T]
Life's a dream, but nothin' is a fairytale
Do you love me? I can barely tell
'Cause I'm up and down, been all around, nobody's callin' now
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Uh, 'cause I know what I been through
But I still, uh, I'd do it all over again
And my life is so sinful (YBN, why be them?)
But through times, uh (King Push)
The good guys always win
[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I can tell you how I first started in this rap shit
8th grade, backflippin' on the mattress
9th grade, pack doin' gymnastics
10th grade, somersaultin' all them crack flips
Asterisk, skipped school, recorded with The Neptunes
We was makin' high school classics
Before I took a kilo and I wrapped it, I rapped it
Around the funeral with the casket (Yuugh!)
Coke avalanche, like a landslide
Only grew my hair this long because my man died
Collect calls on them landlines, I pressed 5
To tell about the new test drive and talk fly, ooh

[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
Life's a dream, but nothin' is a fairytale
Do you love me? I can barely tell
'Cause I'm up and down, been all around, nobody's callin' now
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Uh, 'cause I know what I been through
But I still, uh, I'd do it all over again

Way Back Home Lyrics[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
Uh, you can be who you want to be
But rather be myself, for real
No pretending, no faking me
'Cause gettin' out this shell is real
I don't know where I'm headed next, but
Man, I can't even fake no more
Surrounded by lies and bullshit
Nigga, I can't even take no more
See, I woke up havin' a bad day
And I gotta get the dollar any faster way
'Cause a nigga growin' up never had shit
I was actin' way too passive
I've been up and down, 'round and 'round
Tryna find my way back home
Gone too long, drownin' out
Still gonna play that song
[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, Annie, are you right?
Never got that text back from the other night
Let me tell you something that I really know
I was down bad, up on my ass, I had to go
Okay, sometimes I know I'm dead wrong
So I just put it all in these songs
Shit, I'm still just finding myself
Finding myself up out of this zone, nigga
Wish me well, jezebel, get out of my sight
I excel, then I sell shows out for the night

[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
Uh, you can be who you wanna be
But rather be myself, for real
No pretending, no faking me
'Cause gettin' out this shell is real
I don't know where I'm headed next, but

Gone too long, drownin' out

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tryna find my way back home
I been gone 8 months out the year so far
Made a wrong turn on the dark road on my way back
Crossed through a couple toll roads, had to pay tax
Back and forth, I been fuckin' back
Had to get a bag, had to bring it back
Shit so different now, had to readjust
Ain't too many people that I could trust
Keep to myself, ayy, spend this shit all on myself, uh
Where would I be without self? Uh
Look in the mirror like, "Boy, you look good"
Yeah, that's right, had to pick up myself, uh (Pick up myself)
I'm doin' me, you should do you, fuck everybody else
Don't need nobody else

[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
Uh, you can be who you wanna be
But rather be myself, for real
No pretending, no faking me
'Cause gettin' out this shell is real

Locationships Lyrics[Intro]

On a lovely day, don't care what your last situation was

[Verse 1]
Uh, I got this spoiled L.A. girl, she from Chino Hills
She let me drive her daddy Bentley, swear that she so real
I swear her silent stare so crazy, it be sayin' the most
And when we go out to eat,  she always pay for us both
I got this one chick from the Bay who always bump Mac Dre
I give her constant dick, her consciousness won't go that way
I tell her every day, "Lady, you'll be havin' my baby"
She say, "Yee! Lil' nigga, man, you hella crazy"
I got this one little shawty, her little brother, he rap
He always askin' for a feature, I ignore him and laugh
But when I kill his sister pussy, she gon' lay in the hearse
Her kitty so fuckin' fire, shit, I gave him a verse
[Chorus]
Uh, I say
100 bag, 100 bag, get it right back, huh
Switch it up, flip it up, bet you like that
So, put your number on this paper, 'cause
I would love to take you up
On a lovely day, don't care what your last situation was

[Verse 2]
Uh, I got this cutie from Nigeria who takin' advantage
I hate I had to cut her off, but she just won't stop scammin'
Checked my credit card accounts and asked, "What's the amounts?"
The bitch cleared my whole shit, cashed the check, then she bounced
I found this chick in Atlanta, her elegant country grammar
Swear she bad and she bougie, she got such high standards
I got this good ol' country girl, she from North Carolina
When I'm in that vagina, I just could never decline her
I got this side chick from Chiraq
Who keep that strap and got my pack
Told her, "Bend it over while I break your back"
Watch over my shoulder, don't take no slack
Got this one girl from Texas, she shit on all of my exes
Cooked me eggs and some bacon, I give her good dick for breakfast
I even got this college girl who give immaculate head
But she just so fuckin' broke, I always Cash App her bread
And she just pledged AKA and upgraded her taste
So I fucked her line sisters, took 'em all on a date
[Chorus]
Uh, I say
100 bag, 100 bag, get it right back, huh
Switch it up, flip it up, bet you like that
So, put your number on this paper, 'cause
I would love to take you up
On a lovely day, don't care what your last situation was

[Outro]
Uh, got a spoiled girl from Chino Hills
College chick who love to pop pills
Chiraq girl who's down to kill
Goddamn, my life's a thrill
Nigerian queen who love to scheme
Texas chick who in my dreams
Atlanta girls ain't for the team
This player shit is in my dreams
Aw, man8Embed

Thousand Words Lyrics[Intro]
Uh

[Chorus]
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine‚ huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong‚ huh
The flash is on this little light of mine‚ yeah
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong‚ uh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, a picture's worth a thousand words‚ a video worth a million
But no amount of likes can heal up all this pain that I'm feeling
Maybe conceal it, and hide in all these problems we deal with
I grew up on the principle, to raise a child, need a village
I think we all wanna be a little Instagram famous
Deep down inside, nobody really wanna be nameless
Afraid of being forgotten, so this troll shit, we plottin'
Sittin' on this phone for hours, feel my brain getting rotten
But I can give a fuck less, dawg, a nigga is poppin'
All these bitches that's flockin', shit, a nigga got options
But what's really important is such a silly distortion
We all stuck in this matrix, tryna hide our misfortunes
[Chorus]
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, huh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, uh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah

[Verse 2]
Uh, living in this false reality that's in this picture gallery
Based on a nigga's profile, we guessin' salary
The lifestyle you advertise was quite strategized
Make a minimal amount and then we maximize
These niggas cappin' with lies how they capitalize
Creating they own perceptions, what a massive facade
Digital marketing schemes even broader regime
Live how you want on the internet, who thought of this thing?
I mean, I guess it ain't the worst shit, if life was picture perfect
Who could paint a picture vivid as media circus?
The surface is much deeper than even the Earth is
I searched it, lookin' for purpose like my first kiss
At the same time this shit will have you feeling worthless
Back into reality, woke up and just reversed it
Now I'm a new man, even got a new 'Gram
But let me take a picture with this money by my new Lam'
[Chorus]
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, huh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, uh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah8Embed

Target Lyrics[Intro]
Eee-oooh!
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Uh uh
Daytrip took it to 10, hey!

[Chorus]
Uh, I was cruising in a 6-4 with all of my hoes
Two niggas with a pistol that's ready to go
New bitch named Crystal, steady to blow
My team way too official, with Chevys and Rolls

[Verse]
Seen the red and blue lights, and I got pulled over
Redneck-ass cop asked me was I sober
I said, "Hell nah nigga, stupid question to ask
I got a half pound of weed in the messenger bag"
But I couldn’t tell 'em that, I was wantin' to laugh
That's the number one rule, don’t be flauntin' your pack
And stop asking all these questions, now I'm tauntin' yo ass
And, if you want to search my car, you need a warrant for that
As soon as I said that stupid shit, my gun had slipped into his grip
My nigga, I plead the fifth, not needing this, man, I gotta dip
He said "what in tarnation," hit the gas, I'm car racing
Plus I'm high in the sky, gas got me stargazin'
So here's a little advice, mix sugar n’ spice, and you can get nice
Free my nigga T-Mac, that shit is so whack, they tryna indict
I just paid off all my debt, I'm gettin' them checks, it's changin' my life
I need a little respect, just copped a Patek, just look at my ice
So he ran up, "put yo hands up", you in handcuffs
You done lost your motherfuckin' head like you got dandruff
Woman lie, a nigga lie, fuck the cell, that shit is dry
"Why you pull me over doing 60 in a 55?"
All y'all was suspects, you knew that holmes
Five niggas in the car, and y'all got durags on
Plus y'all bumpin' all the really loud new rap songs
That's three fuckin' strikes, I wanna go back home
How the fuck my strap slip, I be grounded and tight
He said, "boys it look like y'all at the County tonight
And the canines comin', you can stop with the jokes
And while y'all in there tonight, don't be droppin' the soap"
[Bridge]
I know that you hate me, I know that you jealous
I know that you crazy, hiding behind an umbrella
Man I know I'm a target, shit I know I’m a threat
And I know y'all tryna stop me, 'cause you know I'm up next, nigga

[Chorus]
I was cruising in a 6-4 with all of my hoes
Two niggas with a pistol that’s ready to go
New bitch named Crystal, steady to blow
My team way too official, with Chevys and Rolls

[Outro]
Daytrip took it to ten, hey!6Embed
