ORANGE SODA Lyrics[Chorus]
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him

Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up

You know I love it when you talk dirty

You act like a lil' me, I wanna fuck you
You the type to kill me, I won't touch you
You want me drop a band on some cute shoes?
You want me be the man you can vent to?
You let me beat it up, you let me practice

My lil' baby low-key a flexer
Six figs on the whip, that's a price tag
Lil' best friend bitch tried to press me
I'm that underground nigga with the check, though
I hate a bitch that I can't impress
When you come see the crib, you better die, ho
Young nigga sneakin' in through your side door
Baby Keem, not a wave, I'm a vibe, ho
Seven fig nigga with the big drip on me (Yeah)
Post on your block with your wish list on me

[Chorus]
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active

​lost souls (Remix) Lyrics[Part I]

[Verse 1: Baby Keem]
It's a lot of hoes in here, lot of lost souls
Whole group of dime bitches and they in Vogue
Tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
I’m tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
You see that bitch right there, she fucked OVO
You see that bitch right there, she fucked Romeo
Tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
I'm tryna find me a bitch that no one knows

[Refrain: Baby Keem]
Jumpin' out the coupe
Pullin’ out smooth
I'm not afraid to lose
I'll put you on the news
Titties on the FaceTime, let 'em out
Block him, erase him, let me know
Shawty hop in that Bentayga, it's time to go
Whеn I put you in the latest, make surе he know
[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
I'm quick to book a flight, I'm not new to the game
That pussy gettin' tame, go public on the lames
I bought it, say that name, Alexander McQ-Q-Q-Queen
Rolex, woah, heart on froze
Ten white toes
It’s hot out here, I’ve hit my lows
Your leverage in the back
Your best friend was trash, trash, trash
Get gone like The Flash, Flash, Flash
Let's add and subtract, math
I see that you look at these VV-VVs
Let’s get you a piece for me

[Chorus: Baby Keem & Brent Faiyaz]
I know that you kiss and tell
Who's someone that we can tell?
You need a real nigga in your life
I come in like a thief in the night
Two phones, I'm the stereotype
Mama know me, I'm picky who I like
There’s not a fake bitch in sight
Come in like a thief in the night
(Hold up, where my phone?)

[Verse 3: Brent Faiyaz]
Sixteen missed calls
Sorry, I was busy, but I missed you (Miss me when I'm coming home)
If you see me ballin' then my bitch ball
All my niggas ballin' like I'm Rich Paul
Skrrt off in the Audi (Whip), I'ma lift off (Whip, whip)
All your bitches do pilates when you're rich, dawg
So if she can't pop a squat, then that's a rip-off
Keep the CDG, y'all niggas ripped off (Oh)
And your nigga better not think that he the only one (Ooh, ooh, only one)
That nigga match his fitted with some Jordan 1s (Yeah, yeah)
If it ain't Issey, then miss me
NUWO with Hublots
Bad bitch with Chrome toes
And we shoot movies, not photos
She not in it for the fame
Nobody know her name
[Refrain: Baby Keem]
Jumpin' out the coupe
Pullin' out smooth
I'm not afraid to lose
I'll put you on the news
Titties on the FaceTime, let 'em out
Block him, erase him, let me know
Shawty hop in that Bentayga, it's time to go
When I put you in the latest, make sure he know

Busy all the time, babe, too late to reply, babe

Lately, I been stressed (Been deep in a drill)
No regrets when it's real

​trademark usa Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro]
I can't help but feel neglected
Changin' up the schedule, your calendar refreshin'
Time pass and we move on, nobody says shit
How I'm 'posed to act when my morals ain't respected?
How you 'posed to act when your feelings ain't protected?
I'm cashin' checks just to get some neck and some necklaces
What's next? War and turbulence, prayin' on this plane
Success, got a taste of it, never was the same

[Verse 1]
Trademark on that pussy, trademarkin' my brand-new bitch
Yеah, duh, hol' up, blood, hol' up, cuh, hol' up, sis, huh (Hol' up)
LLC the Glock and I LLC my bitch, huh (LLC)
Pass me the rock, I go crazy on my kicks, huh
Had to tеll my grandma, "Sit back, relax" and shit, huh (Make nigga)
Make nigga buy her house and car, she's off the list, huh
Fake nigga, talkin' 'bout he rich but barely is, huh
Eight figures, jumpin' off the stage into the kids, huh (Yeah)
Single out the shooter, take the shooter to the blitz, huh (Yeah)
Droppin' out of school, dropped deposit on their crib, huh (Yeah)
Poppin' out on Instagram, I only post my bitch, huh
I don't need your input, get your two cents off my pic, huh
Generation money, type of money dyin' rich
And I wanna say, "Shoutout to the dead, now I flex," woah
[Chorus]
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (Let's go)
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (Let's go)
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (One)

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of you niggas not taking a risk
I'm taking advantage and taking my course (Kill 'em)
I cannot compete with the mud in my system
My tolerance low, I don't tolerate force
I protect, I am the one
I rose up for the score
I gotta let my ego go
You niggas not ready to settle the war (Yeah)
You niggas not ready to stop bein' hoes
You niggas not ready to open the doors
You niggas run in, take off with the drawer
You niggas not really the richest on Forbes
You niggas not ready to deal with the sacrifices
And instead, you're passin' the torch
And check the surveillance camera at the cemetery
See me dancin' on all of your corpse, go

[Segue]
You could only have love
Ooh, could I say it more?
Could I say it more?
[Part II]

[Verse 1: Baby Keem]
Ayy, E38
Got pulled over twice, had to go and switch plates
Bitch, don't think shit sweet
I'm the same Baby Keem in forty-eight states
I play charades with the bank
Just net ten million, now I'm back with the Wraith
And I'm goin' home with the loot
Mama goin' home with a coupe

[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Baby Keem]
I'm a hot girl
A hot girl
I'm a hot girl (Make me lose my mind)
A hot girl

[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
I took the 'Lac then hopped on the flight
I cannot look towards your jaded advice
I took the torch, I quit being nice
I took the torch, now I gotta fight
You niggas impulsive, quick to make moves
You're biting your flows, a big appetite
I look at the hoes, they not at your shows
I look at your shows, they Oprah white
You gotta be nimble and quick like a fox
I don't move in silence, this shit is abrupt
I'm VVS-ed up, precise in the cut
Did she get a nut? It's not about me
As long as you good, don't worry 'bout me
I'm telling my friends that you not a freak
My new Nia Long is Kaepernick strong
And she not afraid to get on one knee
I'm back at the crib, my memory deep
I think about mama, I'm Baby Hykeem
She got that tatted before I could read
I'm spiritual now, I pray in my sleep
Twenty years long, I never had dad
My dad was a fraud, I had to be tough
Twenty million, ho, that's not enough
Don't ask no questions, bitch, go add it up
I took the light to sacrifice
I sacrificed everything I need
I could probably fuck these bitches in my sleep
Young nigga know the hustle and the Ps
Stressing 'bout money, turned to other things
I was in uncle crib at fourteen
Can't get through to mama 'cause she'd rather drink
Facin' eviction by the thirteenth
[Refrain: Baby Keem]
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen

[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Baby Keem]
I'm a hot girl
A hot girl
I'm a hot girl (Make me lose my mind)

Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandoned
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry when you lost random
I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself

[Chorus]
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide

​hooligan Lyrics[Verse 1]
I get the top while I skeet off (Huh)
Swervin' through lanes, I am limitless
For the ones down, I say, "Free y'all"
I start to question what freedom is
My unc' put the Chevy on fours
I drip in all black like an emo bitch
But these are not regular clothes
These are the outfits I make a movie in (Huh)
Baby Keem count up them Frito Lays
I get the call and I go
Shawty gon' fuck all my goons, stop it
I am above the buffoons, stop it
I am above all the rules
Look at my wrist, it say "Freeze, freeze"
I need to buy a new neck, neck, neck, neck
I stopped wearin' VVs
(Huh, huh, huh)
Pleasе get the fuck out the pic' (Huh)
Hе got to fuck and he got to fuck
So what is the use of my dick?
She wanna put on my jewelry, and play with it
Like she's entitled to it
I'm done, bitch, go to your room

I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give 'em ten and be done with it

Mask on, they don't know who it is
Eat the pussy so good

'Cause niggas be lurkin' when I hit the road, stupid
Y'all gotta deal with the boss
Y'all gotta talk to the ones in control, stupid

I stand on the money so tall I see growth, stupid
Turn all you niggas to ghosts, stupid
Take your credit, now you're toast, stupid (Huh, huh)

HONEST Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Half-past twelve I was all alone
I can't be compromised
Fuckin' on my ex, we ain't apologize
'Cause I'm way too young and you always right
Threw it in my face, I'm on another flight
Girl at home, I ain't been living right
The little arguments always start the fight
I had to get away so I'm with you tonight
Is there another guy?

[Chorus]
Be honest, honest, honest, are you honest?
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, let's be honest
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, are you honest?
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, let's be honest

You're not who I love, huh
I just need to pass the time, huh
Felt good, you felt that
Come and get a peace of mind, huh
Move on, brands on me
Stripes in my pocket and a check on me
Never needed shit so don't you check on me
Home last night, the scent of sex on me
Baby Keem, shit, I'm chosen
I whip that red Toyota like it's stolen
I treat my lil' orange soda like a Hellcat (Hellcat)
She put me out in the winter, feet frozen (Frozen)
She wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm famous (I'm famous)
And that's okay with me, 'cause you been my favorite (My favorite)
I let her do it, she do a lil' bit
A lil' air in her room, she do a lil' bit

​scars Lyrics[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, already livin' my truths
Can't sabotage my love for nothing
'Member I had to choose, "Lord, help me" 'cause I couldn't say nothin'
This remind me of them days before I was buzzin'
Whеn my auntie told me
"Come insidе the house, you make a mess, I'll kick you out"
Don't saturate my love for some respect, I cannot vouch
Judgin' from my shoes and all they seein' is the couch
My moral what I stand on so I got up and I bounced
[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart

[Verse 2]
(Mmm-mmm)
In the backseat, holdin' on for dear life, I must
(Mmm-mmm)
Runnin' them streets, thinkin' that I'll never get touched
(Mmm-mmm)
I've hit the point where enough is never enough, yeah
I gotta see my ceiling with those I trust (Ooh-ooh)
I'd rather feed my feelings with those I lust (Ooh-ooh)
You know what it means, I had low self-esteem
We was livin' on the east side
And I had to pack up my things when my mama was 'sleep
Two kisses to the peace sign
That's when life was on the decline
Two bus passes I'll be fine
[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart

[Bridge]
(Close your mind a little bit)
Can you blame us?
(Random thoughts in my head)
You can blame us
(Can't get the bad out my head)
Can you blame us?
(Is this from the pain I had)
Can you blame us? (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
I need a new fixation (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Open the conversations (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Starting to lose my patience (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Inviting new temptations

[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart23Embed

​scapegoats Lyrics[Intro: serpentwithfeet]
I thought there was redemption in the four ethers
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, free—

[Verse: Baby Keem]
You know I'm borderline more than rich, had to tame the orphanage
Navigated two bitches, textin' them the coordinates
Two phones literally, house party loiterin'
Deals so dummy had to let several lawyers in
One day, I'll tell you how my life was unfortunate
For now, I'll tell you how fast these Porsches get
Story of the young and reckless, 'bout to eat my bitch for breakfast
Pink pussy been a prеference, nеver fold under pressure
Cheap shots, let it rock, eye open, Fetty Wap
Rain like confetti drop, I bet he drop
I don't hate the trendy things, just don't like to feed the trends
Mama gave me all my sins, love me when the story ends
Flowers on my uncle's tomb, thousands to my auntie's too
I'm used to takin' backstreets, last week was nothing new
Bitches is my scapegoat, who I made this tape for?
I tell the story two years later, for now, the case closed
[Outro]
I've heard so much about it
You talk about it all the time
I wanna go there, inside your mind

​cocoa Lyrics[Intro]
Sit down and drink some champagne with me and let me rap

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
I'm balling with my friends
Staring at the money in a trance
Lil' baby, can I be your mans?
I might have to buy her OnlyFans
Huh? She gave me pussy as just friends
I feel like nothing but a middleman
I'm done, baby, I can't be your friend
You might give the pussy to my mans

[Verse 1: Baby Keem]
Huh? Ugh, you toxic
Ah-ha-ha-ha, you toxic
You wanna stay? Don't stay late
Do you not like your house? Hate your place?
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
Spent half a mil' on Grandma house and then I zoomed
Got way more money than my peers, you would assume
In competition with myself, I cannot lose
What we gon' eat?
I don't do Nobu, baby, that's him, not me
We fuck, wakе up, you go, we go to
London, we up, the top floor, еatin' soul food
I don't wanna eat nothin' else
It's new, I wanna see your room
It's new, I wanna fix your wounds
It's new, bitch, I'ma, ha, ooh
[Chorus: Baby Keem]
I'm balling with my friends (Hee-hee)
Staring at the money in a trance (Hee-hee)
Lil' baby, can I be your mans? (Hee-hee)
I might have to buy her OnlyFans (Hee-hee)
Huh? She gave me pussy as just friends
I feel like nothing but a middleman
I'm done, baby, I can't be your friend
You might give the pussy to my mans

[Verse 2: Don Toliver & Baby Keem]
I love to spend it, she coppin' levitators (Uh-huh)
I took her out to eat, I took her out to Denny's
She always call me plenty, drunky-drunky off the Remy (Uh-huh)
Sometimes no callback and Donny tooked off on the Henny
I'm touchin' down in your city just to get it litty (Uh-huh)
Better check the bar when we in the strip, we throwin' fifty (Go, yeah)
Do not be the Ghost, you can't get too close (Nah)
Shawty be doin' the most (Ooh), one hand better ride that roll
Xannies got me goin' down, put me in my mode
I just ate lil' baby up, shawty taste like cocoa
Ten feet, down deep, then I'm here and gone (Cocoa)
Got the beater out the sheets, you couldn't keep her home
Niggas pull up to the function, whip, I leave it on (Pull up)
I leave it on, Told you that I pack a punch
[Chorus: Baby Keem]
I'm balling with my friends
Staring at the money in a trance
Lil' baby, can I be your mans?
I might have to buy her OnlyFans
Huh? She gave me pussy as just friends
I feel like nothing but a middleman
I'm done, baby, I can't be your friend
You might give the pussy to my mans

[Verse 3: Baby Keem]
Two freaks in the club, but they attitude trashy
Don't fuck with broke boys, so the opps down bad
Baby Keem in the cut, she know that's a hefty tag, huh
I just put the whole 702 on my back
You ain't comin' home with us, please, don't you ask
I might throw a hundred ones, please, don't be mad
Tit-for-tat, goin' back and forth is not my passion
Took a trip to Paris to post another caption
It's too much liquor, I get it, huh
Steakhouse, takin' out, eight-hundred-dollar dinners, huh
Baby, go ahead and grab that, t-t-t-t-t-t-tease (Whew, whew, whew whew)
Bruises on your knees (Whew, whew, whew)
While I'm drinkin' tea (Whew, whew)
She gettin' teed, I hate when you tease
Don't try to hide your ass, we'll tag a picture on your back, huh
If that pussy good, there's a chance I get attached15Embed

Fuck you, nigga, if you don't call me back, lose my fuckin’ number
Hol' up, ayy

Beat around the bush, I keep a mop for a misfit

These girls keep calling me handsome, flew out to England and I'm with Lil Mexico
Cropping that bitch out my pic' because she too thick, she must be a messy ho (Yeah, yeah)
Put that on my kids
I'm tired of the boogers, these big protein boogers, get that weak shit out of my face
I gotta be honest, I cannot be happy unless my whole team get a taste
NDA rent, cancel your ass yesterday 'cause a nigga gon' die 'bout respect, huh

Beat your ass up for it, I caught you lackin'
Eat your ass up for it, I caught you brackin'
Kick your ass up for it, I'm with the drama
Front of your mama, front of your daddy, your sister, your aunt
200K taxes, please do not sue me, I can't afford to buy Paul June a blunt, uh
Bitch, hand me the rock
Rock band on me and I look attractive
Holding up five fingers, my numbers are brackin'
Barbarian shit, Barbarian tactic
