Fuck is, fuck
Alright, alright, alright, shit

Ah, fuck! Uh, uh

Peggy, where you been at? Getting all this promo
When it comes to money, bet these niggas is a no-show
I've been out in Bed-Stuy, chilling with my feet up
Laughing at these SoundCloud niggas trying to be us
When I say us, bet, I don't mean no fucking crew
Peggy been a solo act since Looney Tunes and Goofy Troops
Catch me out in Barksdale, counting fettuccine
While you pussy crackers still trying to pass P.T
Ooh, I'm up in Brownsville, strapped with a Kimber
All you yuppie purses getting swiped like Tinder
Now I'm at the White House, looking for your President
Hop out the van, pointing guns at your residence
Ooh, I'm up in Queens now, showing y'all a body
Hoping that you pussy ass c******s try and find me
Chains on my body, looking like a rapper
Acting like a slave when I’m gunning for my masters, nigga
[Break 1]
Fuck these niggas!
Buck these niggas!
Yeah

[Verse 2]
It’s ironic you pressed for a cooking
It’s ironic you talk jail time, but you ain’t never seen no central booking (Yeah)
It’s ironic you hang with a nigga that beat women
And have the nerve to call yourself "Girl Pusher," wow

[Break 2]
You ain’t real, you're a Jarrod, I’ll show you how I really feel (Yah)
White boy better put his hands up, I’m ready

[Verse 3]
And I’m getting Wilder, shoutout to Deontay
Country niggas booming Peggy, I’m the new Beyoncé
Devil on my entrée, cut like Dante
Promise I will never go blonde like Ka- (Hol' up)
Promise I will never go blonde like Kanye
Got so many styles, they should call me Peggy A.J
When I hit the stage, niggas know it’s a payday
Tell your bitch, come here, like I work for Midway, nigga

Grabbed my toaster
Put the gun to the dome of a dead cop
Now, who's the owner?

[Verse 3]
I've been on Xans, keep the coke in the can so you punks understand me (Punks understand me)
I've been on pills, keep the grams in the seal so you punks understand me (Punks understand me) (Whatever you say, officer)
I've been all night with my hand on the pipe so you punks understand me (Punks understand me)
Send a pig to the grave, bad with the brains, punks understand me, I don't
I just don't know
God, God knows
Your soul, just took it
Oh, lord

Say it again, say it again, say it again
Say it again, say it again, say it again (Fuck)
Say it again, say it again
Sometimes I swear
Gotta get them ends, get them ends
Hope the cops don't shoot my friends, shoot my friends
Yeah, yeah

Aw, nigga, nigga, nigga, I'm stayin' (Yeah, huh)

Snuck up in Coachella with a bong, lil' buddy, I ain't Jaden Smith (No)
Herman, nigga, of course (Of course), I'm flagrant (Facts)
I can't keep no job, I can't commit

Pistol whip 'em, I can't waste the bullet in no poser (Blat)
Incels gettin' crossed 'cause I crossed over
How they go from Anne Hathaway to Ann Coulter?
All that shootin' in the air is for posers (Is for posers)
Fast break, we jammin' it, nigga, no floaters
Lames gettin' bolder, straps on the shoulder
They gon' have to get the chap' to console you
[Interlude]
You know, everybody wanna say I do this, I do that (Don't play me)
Everyone wanna act like they hard and shit
But just stop, you're all shit
Damn, haha

Kenan Vs. Kel Lyrics[Part I: Kenan]

[Intro]
Celebration hit, shit
You think you know me
Yo
(Yeah, throwin' it up, ayy)
I wish I had more fuckin' water
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Man, I really, really wish I was Illuminati
Niggas waitin' on the Peg like I'm droppin' Yandhi
Too black, too strong, I'm a lil' thotty (Yeah)
But fuck a big speech
'Cause when I'm rollin'
I'm dressin' up like I'm Prince Peach
And if you sendin' in Marios to defend me
You better make sure to break all the Grammys
Kill all the winners, losers, nominees
Off probation, crackers hatin' accusations
Only on occasions (Yeah)
I don't want relations (Huh), had some thotty phases
Strip, home invasion, fuck with me, man
Y'all better miss me (Yeah)
'Cause if you rollin', I'm stonin' niggas like Rich Keith (For real)
And when I'm whippin' you niggas, it's not slavery (Damn, Peggy)
I'm on a mission to slaughter the competition
And leave you slumpin' on the downbeat, bitch, work
[Chorus]
Huh, how we gon' make this bullshit work? For real
How we gon' make this work? Facts (Facts, facts)
But like, how can I make a good beat? (For real)
I get nervous when niggas want features (For real)
How I'm gon' make this work?

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know this
I don't know this
I don't know this

Bitch, I came back with the Jak and Dax off the shelf
Shoppin' my target, I'm wishin' you well
I don't think prayer can help (Woo)
This feel like Kenan and Kel, these niggas broke like a Dell
Niggas tell, niggas melt, I'ma shoot, you don't sell (Brrt)
I don't think prayers or poems or nothin' can help

My appetite made me nauseous (Huh)

I take the wins out with the losses
You see me grippin' with the gossip
Now I'm eating dinner with the bosses
I hit the vape because it's needed (It's over)
I fall asleep like Tempur-Pedic
Got a light, got a light, got a light, I'll be there
They kill my niggas for no reason
I hear 'em

These bullets coming at you
Take these bullets for me, that's my grimy waifu (Hot)

HAZARD DUTY PAY! Lyrics[Intro: Marvin Winans & Anita Baker]
You think you know me
In the morning
There's a fear of nightfall
When darkness comes and covers all
Hey-ey
Sometimes we feel pain, ay, hey-ey
Sometimes we feel pain, ay, hey-ey

[Verse: JPEGMAFIA]
Uh, if he fall on that floor, let him go, gone
Niggas ain't built for this page in my arc
All this Champagne put a stain on my heart
Don't pick him up, he ain't built for this part
If you wasn't here for them lows, walk
Blick on my hip and I'm dressed like a God
Labels like burners, just use 'em to toss
I take a shot and like Moses they part
Man, I can't tell what you mean (Huh)
Why does your black feel like business to me?
Industry lies never line up on screen (Facts)
Peggy keep scoring, I feel like the Dream
Yeah, what you want, ugh
Y'all love the fake, I've been real from the start
Never hesitate to shoot at a star
Stocked up on weapons and pussy and cars
Just thought you should know, ugh
Look at this lane that I made, it was vacant
These veggie grill niggas don't really want beef
Real niggas dying and fakers replace 'em
Now I see my DNA all in y'all beats
Talk, niggas just rap, don't back up what they talk
Pray for me, got so much smoke in my heart
Rap like I'm gifted and grew up on guard, yeah
Shorty want dick (What?), money, and leverage
One out of three, feel like three when I'm in it (Skrrt)
Peggy the G.O.A.T., more like the feds
As soon as you see me you know that it's finished
And, how can you tell that he's winnin'? (How?)
Floated right through the pandemic, no limits
Stunted creatively, don't got a vision
I die for my pride, you be hiding in gimmicks
Glock with a switch, turn a vegan to spinach (Brrt)
PM-50, we ain't beefin', you dinner
Turn a "I'll do it" right into "Who did it?"
Some you can't speak, you should just buy a ticket
Choke 'em to death with the smoke from this fye
Giving these alt niggas hope when I die
Call up my mama then hang up the line (Bitch)
Money got me feelin' white like I'm 'Thai
Hawk!
When I go out tell 'em Peggy ain't give up, he fought, fuck 'em!
[Outro: Anita Baker & JPEGMAFIA]
Sometimes we feel pain, (Huh, dirty) ay, hey-ey
Sometimes we feel pain-feel pain-hey-ey
We can change, just we feel pain, ay, hey-ey
Sometimes we feel pain, the day, ay
Oo, sometimes we feel pain, ay, hey-ey18Embed

You think you know me
Yesterday I thought I was having a heart attack
Panic attack
Made a wack beat yesterday

Rock bottom when I put... (Alright, hold up)
You it, those clowns
Switch your pitch when I hit the mound
Rap niggas think they so profound
Got 'em lookin' up like who they under now? (Wow)

Bitch, I'm over who you under now, sucker
Hope you had the time of your life
'Cause it's over for you when I come around (Let's go)
Thot tactics
Your shit don't bump, you was not proactive
Sneak dissin', that is not attractive
I'm in a slump and I'm bouncin' back
Bitch crash whips like burnout
Pussy nigga, how you end up caught in traffic?
Chrome ratchet, case basket
With white shooters like the old Mavericks, it's real
Just in case you thought it wasn't
(That's like so amazing)

You wanna take me out yeah, take me out, huh
