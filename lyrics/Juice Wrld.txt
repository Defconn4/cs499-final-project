Lucid Dreams Lyrics[Intro]
Enviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)
[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Outro]
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me505Embed

All Girls Are the Same Lyrics[Intro]
Mhm, they're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

[Verse 1]
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, these girls are insane, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love

[Verse 2]
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah

[Chorus]
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love229Embed

Wishing Well Lyrics[Intro]
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, uh
I can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
[Verse 1]
Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill

Robbery Lyrics[Intro]
Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny, one sec
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?
[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Bridge]
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs, so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you
[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it276Embed

I usually don't speak on shit like this, but
Ain't nobody else saying shit
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)

I will
Oh-ooh (Oh-ooh)
Uh (Uh)

[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Takin' medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)
[Verse 1]
Over ice, I'm freezing
Beautiful eyes, deceiving
We may die this evening
Coughing and wheezing, bleeding
Hi, I'm anxious so
Blood moons are my eyes, stay low
Red and black, they glow
Under attack, in my soul
When it's my time, I'll know
Never seen a hell so cold
Yeah, we'll make it out, I know
We'll run right through the flames, let's go

[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah

Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah, uh)

[Verse 2]
I'm in too deep
Can't swim like me
We're drowning, so I will sing
My demons turn face under me
Inhale, exhale, but I can't breathe
Too busy drinking codeine doin' high speeds
Crash (Shh), pour a four, sip it slow, make the time pass
Take a pill for the thrill, have a relapse
Devil in my head tryna run gym laps
I ain't tryna race, he don't even know me like that
[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous
I know that the truth is hard to digest
Five or six pills in my right hand
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)

Lean wit Me Lyrics[Intro]
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
[Verse 1]
Told her if I die, I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me

Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right
[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (Bad kidneys)

Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up

Empty Lyrics[Chorus]
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos

[Verse 1]
Huh, yeah
I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real, uh, yeah
Life gets tough, shit is getting real (Yeah)
I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Numb my real feels, uh
Devil standing here
Tryna' make a deal, uh
It ain't no deals
Feel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills
I ain't have anything then and I still don't have anything still, still, still, uh
Bein' me, I rock, PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ
These drugs acting like
Mosh pits squishing me
Oh my, oh me, how they kill me slowly
Lonely, I been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I been looking for the signs
But all I can find is a sign of the times
[Chorus]
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos

[Verse 2]
I ain't suicidal
Only thing suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up (Uh)
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to the racks, all them niggas want war
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of livin' in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission
Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
[Chorus]
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole

Conversations Lyrics[Intro]
Oh my God, Ronny

[Chorus]
The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations
I can have my cake and eat it, too
I just gotta make a reservation
Chillin' in my head, but it's hot
Flames everywhere, I see Satan
Demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
Really, really runnin' out of patience

[Verse 1]
T— Timing, timing, timing
All about timing, timing, timing
Sit back in my chair, relaxing and reclining
He has not a care in the world, no, I'm lying
Takin' all these meds to the face got me flying
Takin' all these meds to the face got me dying
Smoke 'til my mind frying, eyes red, high and crying
Numb the pain with Oxy and Dior, yeah, pricey
Juice like 2Pac Shakur, no ice tea
Givenchy, Louis V, Double V, icy
Wedding ring, better things, better half, wifey
Only things numbing me from this hard life thing, uh, alright
[Chorus]
The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations
I can have my cake and eat it, too
I just gotta make a reservation
Chillin' in my head, but it's hot
Flames everywhere, I see Satan
Demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
Really, really runnin' out of patience

[Verse 2]
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, sittin' up
Waiting, waiting, waiting, contemplating
My heart racing
Feels like I'ma die every second of the day
So I gotta get high
Ain't no coming down, ain't no coming down, why?
My anxiety bring me down, that's the fucking downside
It's like every time I ball, I just end up off-sides
This light of mine goes dim tonight
Will I be alright?
Let me guess, no answer, right?

[Chorus]
The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations
I can have my cake and eat it, too
I just gotta make a reservation
Chillin' in my head, but it's hot
Flames everywhere, I see Satan
Demons tryna run up in my spot a lot

Sometimes Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, uh

[Chorus]
I wanna be by my lonely
I pop these Perc' by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
.40 on me, you know it’s my homie
I wanna be by my lonely
I take these Perc' by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
.40 on me, you know that's my homie

[Verse 1]
My mind sometimes gets dark and wild
My mind sometimes
I don’t wan' be bothered
Inhale, exhale, breathing just got a little harder
I mean well, I mean well
All's well, it ends well
Inhale, exhale
Losing my sanity, probably
I'll see you in hell
Yeah, I'ma meet you there
As of lately, my demons, they bother me
When I'm sleeping, they sitting on top of me
And wherever I go, they'll follow me
I fell into the pit and it's bottomless
They want my soul but it isn’t my property
Try to take it from me, demonic robbery
Crazy the way that the devil’ll lie to me
Just leave me alone, I could do better on my own
I get high off my ass on my own
Paranoia is strong
What if she don't love me no more?
I hope I’m wrong
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

[Chorus]
I wanna be by my lonely
I pop these Perc' by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely

Oh, there ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know, oh, oh, oh
There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know

[Verse 2]
Mind fumbling, fumbling, fumbling, fumbling
I wonder if, wonder if, wonder if, wonder if
I'm gonna live, gonna live
All these threats that I get from my enemies
Wonder why I keep a .40 right next to me
Scared of niggas running in my vicinity
I'ma be the killer, ain't no one killing me
That's a better choice like voting for Hillary
Where I'm from, niggas don't give a fuck
So we loadin' up and shootin' like documentary
Numb to the core
I don't wanna feel shit anymore
I don't wanna feel rich anymore
Know that they want me dead
So I'm takin' meds until I fall on the floor
I don't know who to call anymore
I don't know what to call it anymore
Tears fall like raindrops, but nah, I don't wanna ball anymore
Pick up the rock, score
I pill pop some more
Why? It numbs me inside
I know it ain't right, but it's part of the ride
[Refrain]
There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know, oh, oh, oh
There ain't no place like home

Rich and Blind Lyrics[Intro]
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey!)
Fine, fine

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

[Verse 1]
I know I have a purpose, but I don't see the purpose
They tell me the death of me gon' be the Perkys
I know they laced pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal when death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing lil' bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst
Sometimes when I'm high, I feel high in reverse
I ain't going out like that, you fuck with me, you get the work
You ain't gon' see me in no wooden box, I'm gonna shoot 'em first
I promise y'all I'm finna touch the world, yeah, I'ma touch the Earth
But hold on, your girl on my line, I think I may just fuck her first
Yeah, gotta have some crude humor
Just to keep a good vibe going, keep the song grooving
So all my money longer, shout out bro Uzi
Keep my eyes in the sky 'cause that's where I'm moving
[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind (Blind)

[Post-Chorus]
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

[Verse 2]
This is dedicated to you if you felt the lowest of the low
I know how it feels, you don't wanna struggle anymore
Used to ball hard, ain't no triple-doubles anymore
Bitch, I'm talking 'bout my tears
Turned around and faced my fears
I haven't felt this low in years
We die in three like musketeers
Ain't too many real niggas left in here
R.I.P. to all my peers
Smoking loud pack, what you say? I can't hear
But I still hear the fallen ones in my ears
Why, why do we live to die, die?
When it's my time, time, time
I'll leave behind my end, my thirteen reasons why
[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?

Burn Lyrics[Intro]
(If young Metro don't trust you— trust you)

[Verse 1]
I can't take one Percocet, start tonight off, I just took a 60
Burberry on me, shoot you in your back, you just got Pretty Ricky
I tie the Chanel runners, then I get back to running the city
And I know that it's hell coming, I ain't worried, my niggas, they with me
Gotta put the narcotics down, I can feel 'em fucking up my kidney
And punching my liver
If I let it kill me, my mama'll never forgive me
Ain't numbing my feelings, if I let it kill 'em, my baby will never forgive me
This remind me of hell, sometimes I wonder if that's where God really sent me

[Chorus]
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs
I been cursed since birth, guess I never learn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs
I been cursed since birth, guess I never learn
[Verse 2]
The truth hurts, let it bleed out, if they hurt you, let 'em leave
My heart hurtin', let me bleed out, only way I'll find peace
I'm tryna get set free, but these chains on me
Choke me, I can't breathe, what's reality?
Uh, detached from myself
Uh-huh, numb the pain with my wealth
Uh, a bag from Chanel match the double C on my belt, uh
Bands in my pants, I barely be holdin' my pants up
But the money ain't the answer
I'm just tryna reach some new highs
Mix this with that, bet it feel nice
Codeine, only sip if I got ice
Look my girl in her eyes, tell her I won't die
I fell asleep too deep that one time
Woke up to your cry, girl, I'm fine
But I lied
Had a dream, I wasn't gon' wake up this time

[Chorus]
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs
I been cursed since birth, guess I never learn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
