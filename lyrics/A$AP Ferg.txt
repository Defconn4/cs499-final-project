Plain Jane (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Nicki Minaj & A$AP Ferg]
Young Money
Ayo, Ferg
Yeah

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his gut, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me!
[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Yeah)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (You already know, Harlem)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Queens)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Queens for the Kings of the Queens)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I'ma explain why you prolly never see me
I push a Lamborghini, chocha magic like Houdini
My body shaped like Jeannie, booty dreamy, waist is teeny
Yes, I told him to get TIDAL, so he stream me when he leave me
I go hard in the booth, Biggie vibes, gimme the loot
I'm a classy millionaire, bitches ain't got the couth
C-O-U-T-H 'cause you can't spell it either
If I call him then he comin' home runnin', Derek Jeter
Bitches must be eatin' ass, because I swear they're bottomfeeders
Ho, you know that you my son, I shoulda scrapped you as a fetus
All these bitches rockin' inches 'cause they followin' the leader
I should switch it up on hoes and rock a Afro like Lupita's
I don't keep up with the Joneses, but I do know Catherine Zeta
I'm with Candice, TT, Thembi, and Viola, mi amiga
Rap bitches, they gotta check in with the Queen
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, everything in between, uh
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Ride with Minaj, mm, Mashallah
Check in with me, then do your job
Queen is the name, Rafaello did the chain
This is Monse, Patty Plain Jane
Ride with Minaj, mm, Mashallah
Check in with me, then do your job
Queen is the name, Rafaello did the chain
This is Monse, Patty Plain Jane

Work REMIX Lyrics[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
I gotta close the window before I record
‘Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
(Work) Stand up!
(Work) Ferg!
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Coogi down to the socks like I'm Biggie Poppa (baby)
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
‘Cause you know the Fergenstein gettin' plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shinin' in the Benzo
Ballin', got me feelin' like Jim Jones, I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer, then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the building, semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they gettin' on my nerves
I ain't lyin', lay 'em on the curb
Ridin' on a killer who be comin' at Ferg (damn!)
Girl, you twerk, twerk that kitty, girl, make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel, he gon' put him in the earth
Trinidad maniac with an all-gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work
ScHoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth
Polo Ground, A$AP World
[Verse 2: French Montana]
(Haaan!) That ain't Kanye
That's Montana, loose cannon
He shot me, so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in it first
I just sold a swammy with ten homis on it
Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin' for your life
Baby, don't pray for me, pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies

[Chorus]
Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Shout out that motherland
12-years-old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga
All they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad, I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica, I'm your brother
I know a bitch from VI
Yeah-yeah-yeah, that's my partner
You got a problem with it
Then-then-then-then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggas and I fuck with Migos
I fuck with Haitian niggas, all they speak is Creole
I said all I speak is real, y'all niggas might hate me
But that don't get no deal
I said no, that don't get no deal
I just now got my deal, but I been gettin' this money
No green card in this struggle
Immigration give you nothin' but work (put it in work)
[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
YAWK-YAWK, YAWK-YAWK!
A lot of niggas died, should've been from Hoover Street
No, I do not have a car, but I could buy one every week
Pimpin' like I'm 33, move keys like I'm 36
Ship O's like I'm 28
Tacoma know I'm pushin' weight
O-X-Y, I'm in your state
Eatin' off your dinner plate
My heart live where Santa stay
Super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip
She say she never had a Crip
Uh, put in work, all big booties make it twerk
All big titties lift your shirt
Show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front of the church
Deacon said I did my shit
The pastor said, "That nigga turnt"
Pop my collar on my shirt
Make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units; Captain Kirk
Takin' xannies, poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb you first
Turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth
Had to give Young Ferg a verse
[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Outta line, pistols barkin' (argh argh), ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it
Be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress
Side bitch won a beauty pageant
Got a chick that worked at Magic
But I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
See, my daddy in Heaven, right next to Ferg's
You know what's up I'm throwin' bucks
Loaded Lux; put in work387Embed

I think I trade my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

Shabba Lyrics[Produced by Snugsworth & Additional production by Marvel Alexander]

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Short nigga but my dick tall

Only thug nigga down at the Pitchfork
Dirty van bitches wanna suck my dick off
Pop a Xanny for a penny
Get to hit floor, run up in this shit raw

If she caught me, then that bitch would be pissed off (Real nigga shit)
Fergy be mobbing all day, prolly with Marty or Jay

He prolly the one with the K, fronting then he letting it spray
Two shots to a bumboclaat man, Shabba Ranks let it go to your brain
Front then he coming your way, let the semi dump-dump then he coming your way
Dump when the bad man come, my yute don't ramp with me
Coupe full of bad hoes, they all wanna come with me
You got a coupe with a sad ho cause she wanna come with me

Skinny nigga but my dick long (Pause!)

So you know the whole world getting pissed on
I don't really give a fuck if you pissed off
I just bought a Mac-11 from the thrift store
Traded for my gold chain and my pistol
Shoot a rocket make a mothafucka lift off
(Let's go)
Flacko be mobbing all day
With niggas that's chopping that yay
They chopping them choppas they handle my problems
Cause niggas be plotting these days
But the 'Rari kinda fast though, she told me pump my brakes
You stuck with a fat ho, and she wanna stuff her face
To all of my Dominican girls dem, all of my Caribbean girls dem
All my West Indian girls dem, I done fucked a million girls, damn

Hit her with my ding-a-ling-a-ling, maybe run a train
And tell her that my niggas wanna bang and a little brain
And she wanna hang with the gang with a nigga named (Shabba!)

Walk in this bitch with the new Wang, looking like Liu Kang

She like to blow my nine, I think she's going brainless
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt
Semi gon' squirt, damn he got murked

Call me "Mr. East Coast," motherfucker
Let me give them a friendly reminder real quick, yo

Y'all already know the God gotta talk
Every single time I come, you niggas know I gotta do it
Yes, I gotta do it, and I gotta kill 'em, and I gotta hit 'em
Yes, you know a nigga gotta beat 'em stupid
Only got forty-one seconds just to give a nigga shit
Every second, bitch, I gotta use it
Sorry, but a nigga blew it, and I came to grab the microphone
And I make a motherfucker lose it
And I make niggas jump, and I back niggas up
She in the back of the truck
Lil' mami wanna fuck and she really wanna suck
When I finish with her, then we go in the back of the club
And we do this shit again, my nigga, pronto
Bip-de-badda-de-booda-de-beat it like a bongo
Banging on the pussy like a nigga named Alonzo
Head game crazy, that make her the head honcho
Mad 'cause I took his bitch, and now, he think he macho?
Somebody better call the cops, yo
'Fore we run up inside of that nigga little condo
Put him in a box, put the nigga in a cargo (Cargo? Cargo!)
Shut a nigga down (Fake bitch)
Throw a bottle at you, shut a nigga mouth (Break shit)
Come and follow, nigga, stand up on the couch (Shake shit)
Let her swallow, niggas know we're in the house (Trey-fifth)
East Coast, nigga!

1-0-0-3-1 is where my ZIP is
Live in Har-ar-lem, up in the trenches
Run through a bodega like I ain't got riches
Run through a bodega like I ain't got— (Come on)
Don't do it for the haters, I do it for the bitches
My flow Al-Qaeda, I kill rap niggas
Y'all Now-and-Laters, uh, sweet ass-niggas
Soon as you get famous, they wanna ass-kiss (Muah)
Only thing that I'm missing is Hov verse (JAY-Z)
I get a feeling they want the old Ferg (Yah)
"Cocaine Castle", "Hood Pope" Ferg (Yah)
Got a question to ask you: Do you know Ferg?
Do you know that I come from where the toast burn?
New York, New York, uh, 1-4-3rd
On Hungry Ham, up on the corner
Fiends gangster-leaning, never sober
From being in the streets to run a culture

Who's that jiggy motherfucker with the clothes, bruh? (Yeah)
I'm finna kill these motherfuckers with the flow, bruh

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Blackin' like I'm fresh up out retirement
My flow still monumental, mental
Couldn't ride an instrumental, but they ridin' dick
I set the standards for requirements, so call the firemen
Just me, myself and I, the world is mine, I put the "I" in his
His posse too clean (Ayy), his diamonds like TIP (Ayy)
His skin too clear (Ayy), his bitch gon' stare (Ayy)
So mind your biz, how they find the time for minding mine

With Kylie's lips, oh my, oh my (Run it)
Run it, run it like you want it (Run it)
Run it, run it like you stole it (Run it)
Running, running like I'm going (Woo)
Running, pitching like I'm bowling (Woo)
In my city, gangs run the inner city
Load a semi for the chiddy bang
Flacko, Fergie, Frenchie with the bitties
Hit up Remy for the pretty gang

[Verse 4: Dave East & French Montana]
Lately, I feel like a Beatle
I'm Paulie McCartney just rocking Moschino

Phenomenal deepthroat (Phenomenal)

My noodles was Ramen, go Google my diamonds (Go Google)
I got some shooters in college
I feel like a coach, I'm recruiting and signing, look
I still be moving in silence
I'm ballin' in blue like I'm hooping in Dallas (Ballin')
Bitch, I don't play for no Mavericks
You need to think who gon' pay for your casket (Who?)
Ignorant bastard (Hanh)
But I'm still conscious enough to give hope to the masses (Hanh)
Watch the coke do gymnastics (East side)
Dominique Dawes, foreign my car when I'm mashin' (Hanh)

Chain, busting it down
Wrist, busting it down (Down)
Your bitch busting it down (Down)

You niggas is comedy (Bling)
Talking fast like Bone Thugs-N-Harmony (Harmony)
KRS-One, Big L flows (Flows)
Son of a gun with the Buffalo ('Lo)
Head on my wrist is a P1 (One)
Made more money than E1 (One)
One time Chinx, two time Yams (Yams)
Get the money, slide like a violin (Violin)
You know my nigga Max almost home? (Ha)
You know who run the East Coast zone, nigga? (Ha)
(Maybach Music)

[Verse 6: Rick Ross]
In the kitchen, culinary, I could whip a Bloody Mary
And I wish that blood would dead me, I'ma get your brother buried
Gangbanging with your halo, business on the payphone
Bitches pussies drying up like Taz's Angels
Never was a client 'cause that boy ain't buying it
And I got a bottom bitch, my top come on consignment
Step up from the minor league, double-M the dynasty
No, I never sold dope; I just got me a finder's fee
Following my frequency, niggas rapping week to week
Suckers be so weak to me; text, but don't speak to me
You can never speak for me, see the B.I. chemistry
Check into the crazy house, I'ma turn the labels out

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up (Remix)
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up (All right)
This that East Coast, motherfucker (Ooh)
But I know this West Coast— (Snoop Dogg!)

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
Ten-twenty was my date of birth, the day I came to Earth
Bottle-sipping, love to burp, young nigga that's doing dirt
"Long Beach" across my shirt, all y'all niggas gon' get murked
What the fuck is you talkin' bout? Me and Ferg, we gon' put in work
Bang on you, gang culture, out of this world
It's all on a bitch—is she a Blood? Is she a Crip?
Don't slip, think not, on the block where it's hot
Legalize with the nines, give a fuck about a cop
Real shit, this is it, from the bottom to the Bay
This is anybody K, California all day
Yes sir, on the curb, Mossberg by the van
Lil' homies on the roof with the "blam, blam, blam!"
Long Beach, popping pill on 'em
I been working so hard, nigga, get your bale on
I been working so hard, nigga, work to sell somethin'
I been working so hard, welcome to the Hell-zone, zone, zone

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg & Snoop Dogg]
See I'm from Long Beach
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up (Remix)
See I'm from Long Beach
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up (Oww, all right)
See I'm from Long Beach
This that East Coast, motherfucker
California, motherfucker, see I'm from Long Beach
Call me "Mr. East Coast," motherfucker (Long Beach)

Dump Dump Lyrics[Verse 1]
Her hands all on my fade, bitch pop that ass in the coup
That bitch got Lisa Leslie money, she balling, Sheryl Swoops
She keep rubbing her nose, I can tell she wanna snoop
That coke make my dick numb, she put it all in her glutes
Feel like Bishop from Juice, gun all in my boot
Sayonara feeling sauna when I blast that ass with that Uz', ooh
Blast that ass with that Uz', better hope to God it ain't you
Trap Lord with about ten jeeps, no telling what I might do
I fucked your bitch, nigga and she about to fuck my crew
She just finished with Twelvyy and now she off to Lou
Pussy-ass nigga wearing all black, claim they off to shoot
I pray to God he ain't lying, my gorillas live in the zoo
I got killers with the deuce-deuce, them Tan Boys my niggas
They gon' ride with me too, bust they nines with me too
That's my bilingual crew, who do sign language true
Bandannas in they pockets, how the fuck we gon' lose?
[Chorus]
I fucked your bitch, nigga, I fucked your bitch
I fucked your bitch, nigga, I fucked your bitch
She sucked my dick, nigga, she sucked my dick
She sucked my dick, nigga, she sucked my dick
Ride around town with about 100 niggas
When you see me come around, don't try to run up on a nigga
Four pound lay 'em down, now you six feet under, nigga
If you feel some type of way, then let me see you dump nigga

[Verse 2]
Ride around my city, feeling like P. Diddy
Glock 9 in my silk shirt, nigga, no Pac and no Biggie
Spilling on, my teeth hurt but these grills worth a milli'
I was in the club, I seen the whole thing, I was right next to Meek Milly
Shout outs my nigga Chrissy, don't bug over these bitches
I ain't fucking with these ratchet hoes, I put a slug in these bitches
Pop a pill in her asshole, put drugs in these bitches
Impress my girl, she fine as fuck so I ain't loving these bitches
I just be fucking these bitches, ain't no love for these bitches
Diamond Dollas, that Fergenstein, I DDP on these niggas
Feel the heat when it bigger, bullet creeped to his window
Nigga, I'm going double wood, fuck around and catch a splinter
Nine milli', my nigga, get hung, high ceiling, my nigga
All the macks in they Maybachs, no 550, my nigga
They saying Ferg went from "Kissin' Pink" to a Young 50, my nigga
I'm in court for your bitch ass, that's real shitty, my nigga
[Chorus]
I fucked your bitch, nigga, I fucked your bitch
I fucked your bitch, nigga, I fucked your bitch
She sucked my dick, nigga, she sucked my dick
She sucked my dick, nigga, she sucked my dick
Ride around town with about 100 niggas
When you see me come around, don't try to run up on a nigga
Four pound lay 'em down, now you six feet under, nigga
If you feel some type of way, let me see you dump nigga

[Outro]
Dump Dump

Let It Go Lyrics[Intro: A$AP Yams]
Trap Lord season begins, now repent your sins
This Yamborghini on the motherfuckin' check-in
You know I had to hang glide through for this one and all that
You know, we at the all-star game right now, eyes closed (Swish)
Shootin' fadeaways from half-court (Elbow in the rim and all that)
Tomahawk jams (Y'all still in the D-League doing, uhh, layup drills)
Ya heard? Ya feel me?

[Chorus]
Kill a motherfucka with the Magnum .44
Find a chump slumped, nigga, magnum on the road
Body full of bullets when they found him on the road
Lay a fucker down, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
Semi or the tech, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
Semi or the tech, spray it at him then reload (Fergie!)
[Verse 1]
Ride Maybachs like Ross (huh) 550 Benz, four doors
Praying for my niggas, they lost, dying no thing, they wolves
Riding on a gang that floss, multiplyin' by the gang that bucks
Pull a 9 on anything we spark, ménage ain't a thing, they whores
Pussy so good, need more, let me get in those drawers
5-0 in the corner store, he heard all them claps with a round of applause
Spit at your back and you lie on the floor, rat-a-tat-tat and you gon' see the Lord
Bitch like horse, X In Her pores, want more sex, all in her jaws
Molly!

[Chorus]
Kill a motherfucka with the Magnum .44
Find a chump slumped, nigga, magnum on the road
Body full of bullets when they found him on the road
Lay a fucker down, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
Semi or the tech, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
Semi or the tech, spray it at him then reload (Fergie!)

[Verse 2]
I'm grippin' the Mac and you under attack
Spit at your back and you taking a nap
No heart a be pumping, your body relaxed
You talk to me dumb and that's how I react
One arm in the air like I'm waving a cab
The 9 is a bitch and she making it clap
I'm palming a 5th like I'm giving a dap
Be ready to scrap when you talk to the Trap (My condolences)
You are now talking to a boss, Lou Bang still ride in the Porsche
Two thou' for the grill they cost, white gold teeth, no floss
Young Trap Lord like Doss, two bitches in the crib, no drawers
She rocking the mic with her jaws, I call that bitch Nicki Minaj
She pop one pill no cough, when shit get real she spark
Givenchy my bitches bought, smoke that life 'til you niggas see God
Getting head in the foreign cars, get the head from the foreign broads
Hasta la vista, señor, pussy ass niggas a see Allah (Fergie!)
[Chorus]
Kill a motherfucka with the Magnum .44
Find a chump slumped, nigga, magnum on the road
Body full of bullets when they found him on the road
Lay a fucker down, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
Semi or the tech, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
Semi or the tech, spray it at him then reload (Fergie!)

[Outro: A$AP Yams]
So it's like, "Fuckin' Problems," platinum (Bling, bling)
LongLiveA$AP number one album in the country (Bling blaow)
Sold out tours, what's next? Trap Lord
Let these motherfuckers have it, let 'em know we not playing this year
The limb's never been so relaxed, ever, heheh
It's lonely at the top; all this shrimp, nobody to share it with
We ain't trippin' though, heheheheh
Y'all walkin' 'round with wrinkled silks, looking crazy, nah mean?
Pay your dry-cleaning bill and all that (pay that, pay that)
Cause it's like, it ain't even a competition no more, hahahahahah51Embed

Hood Pope Lyrics[Chorus]
Ohh, let me sing my song
If you feel this shit, mothafucka sing along
Ohh, this the Hood Pope
Chain hang low, red rubies and the gold
Ohh, young Trap Lord
Feel your pain, I be down for my people
Ohh, drinking Jesus juice
Jeans hang low, rare rubies and the gold
[Verse 1]
And we sip, cause we hurting
Pull a chrome fifth when they murk them
Then murk off in Excursion
All cause a nigga be lurking
Big money shit we earning
A bunch of hooligans need churching
I'm the Hood Pope, these my children
And I'll be their Donnie McClurkin
Gold teeth when I'm smirking
Bunch of little kids running 'round need nurturing
Lord know that I ain't really perfect
All of these clowns run around this circus
Lord please, what is my purpose
Besides fucking these Persians?
Popping these bottles and popping these models
Please tell me where is the Sherman
And I'm smoking my weed, put me in my zone
Demons chasing me, cause they want my dome
And I carry the heat, and I sleep with the chrome
Cause I'm in some beef, and they want my dome
[Chorus]
Ohh, let me sing my song
If you feel this shit, mothafucka sing along
Ohh, this the Hood Pope
Chain hang low, red rubies and the gold
Ohh, young Trap Lord
Feel your pain, I be down for my people
Ohh, drinking Jesus juice
Jeans hang low, rare rubies and the gold

[Bridge]
God say "Son, you don't wanna go down"
Now you praying in that trap when you hear that gun sound
God say: "Son, you don't wanna go down"
Now you praying in that trap when you hear that gun sound
God say: "Son, you don't wanna go down"
Now you praying in that trap when you hear that gun sound
God say: "Son, you don't wanna go down"
Now you praying in that trap when you hear that gun sound

[Verse 2]
And they told you, told you time again
That ain't you gon' find your friends
You talking about you riding with them
And fighting with them, those ain't your friends
You dying, lying on cement, momma be crying "Don't take him!
Gotta be trying but he sin, I promise he won't, ever again
God, he was a little child, he was a good kid for a while
He found the streets and then it got wild; God, I promise, never again
God, he is my only child, please awake him so he smiles"
But all she hear is lonely sounds, now he won't talk ever again
[Chorus]
Ohh, let me sing my song
If you feel this shit, mothafucka sing along
Ohh, this the Hood Pope
Chain hang low, red rubies and the gold
Ohh, young Trap Lord
Feel your pain, I be down for my people
Ohh, drinking Jesus juice
Jeans hang low, rare rubies and the gold57Embed

Lord Lyrics[Produced by: Ozhora Miyagi & Crystal Caines]

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I ain't never had shit
Not a pot to piss, window to throw it out of
Sherm got me high, get your ass in the shower
Took one pull, shit, told her it wasn't sour
Hit a double drum chant getting louder
Chant getting louder (Louder)
Mulan bitch wanna fuck for an hour
Start sucking dick, bitch, enough of the powder
Come fuck with this bougie nigga
Come fuck with this bougie nigga
High fashion, Ksubi nigga
You fuck with them booty niggas
'Cause you fuck with them booty niggas
Now Fergie all up in your groupie, nigga
Reincarnation of Master Fard
Elijah Muhammad reside in my heart
Diss and I'll blow, and shouts from Allah
Knowledge was born with science, young lord
Tripping yourself is no valish, young lord
Study your scriptures and follow your God
Life in the trap I know times will get hard
I'll pick up your life, just abide by the Lord
[Bridge: A$AP Ferg]
Abide by the Lord
Abide by the Lord
Abide by the Lord (Alright!)

[Verse 2: Flesh-N-Bone]
You 'bout to get it from a general, I don't know if they can hear me though
Don’t you niggas ever bother tryna see me, I'm a criminal
Oh Lord, once he's in the sight of a scope
I'ma let them have it when I sever
Damn, he wants to make me set it off
I'ma bury you motherfuckers without a coffin
Never taking no shorts, we never taking no losses
When you're dealing with my crew, A$AP, Bone, yeah, we bosses
Anybody with a bone to pick
Now when I level my charge, I'm damn sure to make it stick
You must be looking to suffer, well I'ma make it quick
Gotta train load of 'ish that’ll make ya sick
I'm here to wipe 'em out quicker than a pandemic
Bone came original, not a gimmick, can you dig it?
Hell yeah they can dig it while I'm sitting on my throne
Steady laughing at you niggas trying to get it (Get it, get it)

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Man, I'm runnin 'til the end of this and I don't give a fuck if I was 86'd
A muthafucka play me like I'm Canibus
I'm ready for the battle like I'm takin' Diz
I'm never gonna take it in and nobody can break it in
As-salamu alaykum for the bacon and a little bit of coke
I put the cake in and it's certified dope
Having anything to do with it, we selling every rock that they can smoke
So take a toke and I'ma rake it in, Pillsbury the dough
To the dome like I'm seeking through the soul
Like I'm peeking through the soul
But I'm reekin like our reefer, rather keep up with her, go straight to the dro
Creeping on 'em, peeping on 'em, leave 'em in the zone
They don't even really know
Looking on 'em, keeping on 'em, taking every foe
For the love of the money, I gotta reap in what I sow
But I keep it what I know for the ending of the row, gotta go, will I go?
When I get it I'ma know to follow my known foe
Know Cali and know Coe, my caliber lock and load
Alabaster box when I cock and I crow
Got a Glock and I'm Bone Thug, where you wanna flow?
To the clock and the time zone
Spirit gon' fly, all y'all niggas dead to the life force cyclones
Right now when they hydro
What about the well known Cairo?
[Verse 4: Layzie Bone]
Got 'em stuck in the grave
I'm on the grind full time, never rest to get paid
A little hustling mothafucka put the brush to the face
I cut the braids, hit the stage, now they looking amazed
I went from cooking the yay to hundred thousand dollar shows
Got a booking today and I'ma split it with my bros
Gotta get it how we go, come meet me with the pros
No, I'm never gonna fold, watch the bank account grow
If it ain't about dough, then it ain't about jack
And I'ma take it like I want it, I ain't giving it back
I get us in with a stack and then I get on attack
I'm like the Tasmanian Devil, nigga bigger than Shaq
Call the reaper, get the shovel, I'm a certified rebel
In a league of my own and that's a whole nother level
Nothing's free, I never settle, keep the pedal to the metal
When them haters in my rearview, hello, hello

[Verse 5: Krayzie Bone]
Burn! Baby, let it burn, now it's my turn
I get in a nigga's system like a hundred vials of sherm
And then I kill 'em with two thousand words in two minutes
You never heard another nigga spit it like my niggas
Yeah, but you heard 'em try to get it but they couldn’t get it quicker than the realest
Man, they thinking they can deal with this and knock me out my rhythm
But I’m never gonna be the fuckin' victim
'Cause I’d rather be the suspect, haven't I given them enough yet?
Can't they understand they ain't dealing with a punk bitch?
One quick move and it's murder
And I'ma serve a nigga exactly what he deserving
A$AP, but wait a minute
I'm prolly one of the sickest niggas that ever did it, I'm in it 'cause I'ma win it
I'ma mothafuckin' lyrical tyrant, pivotal giant of this shit
And I do way more than just twist the words
You better listen and observe how I rip the verb
Niggas get the nerve to run up on me but my shit's superb
I’ll probably hit a nigga once 'fore he hit the curb
So get at me, I'm kinda trigger happy
When it come to shootin' my gift, I'm like a .44 magnum, stag one
Backin' em up, body bag full of niggas' wack raps
That’s wack so I'm stacking em up
Kray Jack in the cut, still got a little bit of murder for 'em
Murderous poet, I create a bloody murder poem
So when they run up on me, nigga, be ready to show em
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum, rum rum rum rum
[Outro: Bizzy Bone]
Yo, before this project
We’d like to thank the Most High
On behalf of the A$AP Mob, Bone Thug and all in attendance
Knowing that all things belong to those
For the cleanliness and the power, the first in the nation
To prove who they are
Through infinity, through eternity, through time span
Standing, one man, if you hold my hand, hold my hand
(Make sure it's a hand)
With all things around me, I will never win
I won’t win with angels, I won’t win with the brothers
I won’t win with Rome, I won’t win with Sodom and Egypt
(I keep a corpse close to my home)
Let us roll, tell them why we did what we did, if we did
In Jesus name, Amen18Embed

Persian Wine Lyrics[Intro]
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild

Pity my simplicity
Allow me to come to thee
Lord Jesus forgive me for my sins
Make sure that you take care of my family, my mom
God bless my dad
Look over me and my niggas, Amen

Twinkle in the eye 'cause you ridin' with a star

Bet that nigga teeth look better than yours
All gold slugs and I don't need to floss
Young Trap Lord, might die on a cross
Gold link chain swing down to my balls
Bout to rule the world, gettin' signs from the Lord
Lord say "Ferg, damn you my boy
Wanna be on top? Nigga, it's your choice"

Fuck your hypothesis, I be on that rider shit
Bang him over the head, I bet that shit'll silence him
Margiela stallion, bitches be Italian
God pray for me, I know my daddy smiling and
I'm gon' make you proud, save me a cloud and when
I make it to heaven you'll be by my side again
Bless all my violent friends, they don't know right
All they know struggle pain all of their life
Washing down pain with that purple and Sprite
Murder death kill nigga fuck your side
Uh, cause D Ferg got the fuckin' toast
Uh, cause A$AP fuckin' do the most
Uh, with the .9 in my 40 Belows

Boy you ass, you softer than breast
Bloody murder, I lay you to rest

Put shells in your stomach, like pussy, you wet
Flocka like Rambo, I stay with the ammo
Test me, that's a gamble like Russian Roulette
I stay with them commas, I been through the drama
You going to war, you better invest
Fuck is a K? I ain't impressed
Got thousands of shooters I pay just to flex
[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & A$AP Ferg]
Niggas say I'm real, bitches say I'm hot

All my people say "Stomp!" like I'm Kirk or something
Put 'em in the dirt like "Work" or something
He get on my nerves so fuck him
You turn ass like Tahiry when I pressed your buttons
And that was no diss, niggas quick for discussion
Y'all quick for the tweeting, y'all quick to be tumbling
How about a Vine, two clips to your spine
And Instagram pics of me dumping
I'm feeling your bitch so I'm fucking

It's a homicide, a bloody murder
All my niggas down to murder

I'm finna get buck and start bringing the burner
Now I'm beating that ass like Ike did Turner
You sit in a box, you sleep in a hearse
Wherever you from, that's my turf
Fergie Ferg and I'm putting in work
Young Flocka Flame gon' put 'em in the dirt
Sipping on the Henny and a nigga go berserk
Couple bitches gave me brain, then I skeet on they skirt
Yeah Ferg, you nasty
Pay attention, focus on what we came for
Got the drop on a nigga, got the info
Soon as I hop out then go click-clack, then go bang

Niggas say I'm real, bitches say I'm hot
Disrespect the Mob or Squad, then you gettin' shot

Riding in a limo with a bunch of fake friends
Who be only around me cause I make ends
I feel the pain for my bro cause his dad died
My daddy gone too, my nigga, that's life
But them niggas did it up in they past lives
Moët with Crystal nigga, that's right
Bet them niggas dressed up in them white suits
Rhythm and the blues in a white coupe
Spit it through a cloud with a nice boo
Daddy, Anna-Nicole probably like you
Ahh, I'm so vicious
Riding in a coup with a bunch of killas
Are you gangbanging, man? I couldn't see it
Like twisting up your fingers in a pair of mittens
Put 'em in the water with a bunch of fishes
Watch a frog leap were his fucking chin is
Are you Popeye? Eat your fucking spinach
Bunch of young Trap Lords and we down for sinning
A$AP Soul, that's my fucking nigga
Young Tarzan, that's my little nigga
Crawling in them bitches like a caterpillar

Dreams, Fairytales, Fantasies Lyrics[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah, ah

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg & Brent Faiyaz]
I call you gata‚ 'cause you's a wild cat
You leave me with a big neck scratch when I hit it from the back
Pillow under your stomach‚ you like it like that
They catch you half-sleep so you can't fight that
We go for hours‚ fuck in the shower, pussy devour
Foreplay in the kitchen, bend it over the counter (Mm)
You taste like candy‚ I eat it like Sour Power
You be likin' it rough, your body soft as a flower (Yeah)
And when we finish, you be holding me (Yeah)
Got your head on my chest‚ you consoling me (Yeah)
Quick to close the blinds when I'm hitting that
But I'm hoping you leave it open, so they know it's me (Damn)
From the beginning, you said it was mine
And I can tell the way you said it that you weren't lying
You see me text her (Yeah) like, "Baby, you fine"
And I can still feel the tingle up and down my spine
[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
I'm in a dream, fairy tale, fantasy when you're around me (Ooh)
I must be losing my mind
Dream, fairy tale, fantasy when you're around me (Ooh)
I must be losing my mind

[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz]
You know you belong to me
You can bring your whole squad plus three
You don't like to get told what to do
But you like it when I put you on a leash
All fours for me, on the floor for me
Have you scratching walls, parkour for me
And every night, I'll hit it right
I'ma bring you on tour with me (Yeah)
You the one for me
And even if you're wrong for me
It's a good mistake, even when I'm wide awake

[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
I'm in a dream, fairy tale, fantasy when you're around me (Ooh)
I must be losing my mind
Dream, fairy tale, fantasy when you're around me (Ooh)
I must be losing my mind

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg & Brent Faiyaz]
Uh, oh, this song feel like new pussy, makin' it gushy
Heartthrob of the projects, spandex and a hoodie
Timbos and your baby father was a bimbo (Yeah)
Heads know, rather be bothered with all of them hoes
We could fly to Jamaica, fuck all the haters
I take you out of the projects, mansions with elevators
We can drive and hit the city in Lambo
Then lay down on the beach and watch the sand blow
Have you ever spent money without a worry?
Shopped 'til we dropped, Celine bags and Burberry
Bathin' suits, Chanel boots for dinner time
Baby, we looking good, so you know we finna shine
Then hop back in the villa to get up in her
Fireplace when it's winter, we fuckin' on the chinchilla
You fuckin' with a winner, the heavy spender
You know it's me, I'm tryna bring out the freak in you like Jodeci
[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
I'm in a dream, fairytale, fantasy when you're around me (Ooh)
I must be losing my mind
Dream, fairy tale, fantasy when you're around me (Ooh)
I must be losing my mind (Ooh)

They come to my house, they booty bounces like it's three to one
Feelin' my touch, fuckin' that bitch and she's lickin' my nuts
It's no love, ridin' that coupe 'cause she's fillin' my life

Growin' up in Southside Rexdale wasn't fun
Giuseppe walkin', know some people on the run
Shouldn't have a clean record with the shit I've done
I won't say shit 'cause I know how to bite my tongue (I won't talk)

Not another white bitch, time for a re-run
Need some green sum, seen some homie
Send you a ton but I keep some homie
King of Queen, the kind you blaze
Whole team on lean on Pisa sway
I'm ghetto and the pump got a critter all splattered
Have another hit but I want to hit the shatter
Dabbing all night really got me faded
Take a hit of my shit feel upgraded
Twist that shit like your weave got braided
Chilling in the palm trees feeling real shaded
Pass that shit like a deadly virus
She want to hit, that's Miley Cyrus
Hit it so hard, my god, she likes this
Change that chick's name to Miley Cypress
[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
A$AP Fergie, A$AP Mobbin'
Bitches on my ballsack, want a nigga Martian
And a Miss America, picking any target
Bitch give me long neck like an ostrich
Aston Matthews in an Aston Martin
Vroom, driving retarded
Sipping on that Crissy cause a nigga really ballin'
Headed to the telly with a bunch of Kelly Clarksons
They love that I'm from Harlem
They love to see a broad and
Another broad and kiss and massage 'em
Give them booty shots might Nicki Minaj 'em
Dont let 'em get me hard then
Tell they friend give me jaws like a shark fin
You'll play Halle Berry in Monster Ball and
I'll be Trap Lord Billy Bob Thornton

[Verse 3: A$ton Matthews]
Oh shit, who let these Hulk Hogan hoes in with nose and chest open?
That water hose got us sipping, that Molly Maid got us dripping
Ok, I get that A$AP, A$AP
Take naps from the K clap, I'll bring it where you lay at
Gang colder than the face off, you don't want to face that
Got these hoes dripping out the Versace, 4-4's keep the 4's off
Four boats so the hoes drop and that rose gold keep the dome sloppy
Haaan, molly party, molly party
Them bitches know it's a molly party
Dodging cases cause I'm dropping bodies
Number one stunner, camouflage Hummer
Nose job, had to paint it white for the summer
I'm a hit stick drummer, heavyweight
Triple H, Hall of Fame head hunter
Minivan gram Van Dam, hand in hand in the Trans-Am
Choppas all test tap dance, Hammer Time Ham dance
Put that pussy on a handstand
[Chorus: A$ton Matthews]
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face

Yeah, better get the fuck out my face with all that
Or get a broken beat down with a baseball bat
Ferg said call a nigga ASAP back
Oh, just looking for his baseball bat
I'm a thug with a baseball cap
Got a bad bitch slim waist from the back
Ass ain't fat but her face all that
Oh, she like to fuck in my baseball cap
I'm a CB-GB, Crazy Baldhead Grimy Bastard
You a BG-GB; Bitch that's Gonna Get Blasted
So don't set trip cause I love to trip
My niggas trip, acid
I don't give a fuck if it's fake or real
Those titties coulda been plastic
Official Nast', my gang's official
Mad faced niggas with anger issues
Hundred mad niggas got a gang of pistols, blaow
Now, how the fuck can a stranger miss you?
My whole set, ganged up
Play yourself get ya banged up
Suicide, you get hanged up
She done fuck the crew, she got ganged up
