[Verse 1]
G.I. niggas stay bout it
Take a nigga life don’t doubt it
Church and the liquor store crowded
911 is a joke don’t dial it
We ain't really tripping when the money stay piling
Money comin slow then mothafuckas get violent
I just want a crib and a coupe low mileage
Blowing on some dope with a yellow bone stallion
So high, and niggas wanna know why I ride
With semi automatic by my side
Cause I got niggas comin at my head
But I won’t let them bitches stop my bread
A mothafucka wanna short my dough
I hit him twice with the black fo-fo
The witness, courtroom no-show
And what a nigga don’t know, won’t go
‘Dro, hoes and the dope game made me
On the front page magazine, no label
Industry don’t want him cause the nigga’s too gangsta
Probably never heard him on ya radio station
Way too thug for these mothafuckin’ rappers
Rap way better than ya neighborhood trapper
Man came down on the uppity bitch
I be fuckin' the bitch, let my niggas smash right after
Dope in the kitchen gotta get it stretchin' n whippin'
Know some niggas that slippin, we can hit a lick if you with it
Then I ship and deliver, I ain’t took a trip in a minute
Now i’m in the position, I can give it to my lieutenant
Need a mothafucka robbed, I’m the nigga for the job
Peace to the Slammin' and the 5-Trey Mob
What you know about that life in the mask
Them Gary, Indiana niggas gift wrap ya casket, how ya love that?

[Verse 2]
Yea, I ain’t got time for these bitches
Ain’t gotta dime for these bitches
Breakin' it down for 3 bitches
Duffle stuffed with 3 6’s
Heat under the pillow, I sleep wit' my Mrs
And I’m havin' dreams that’s bigger than 6 digits
Niggas where I rest possessed to whip chickens
Livin' on ya dick til ya hit the next shipment
So high, and niggas wanna know why I, ride
With semi automatic by my, side
I need a nigga that’s fosho gon' bust
And really I’m the only nigga I, trust
And really I'm the only nigga that, cold
New shoes, Cadillac on vogues
Shine for the dimes and the rat, hoes
Check a pack, write a rap, crack, sold
And my trunk leave cracks in the pavement
Chevy only carry heavy weight, Lord save 'em
Just another victim of the game, can you blame ‘em
And he stay paid, can’t a lame nigga fade 'em
And most of you niggas in the rap game dick blowers
But at the end of the day they don't get shit for it
But me and mine’s gotta eat, so I’m beatin’ up the street
Dinner time, man, I gotta hit a lick for it
Send ‘em to God, tryna rob the godfather
And if you scared of catchin’ a murder then why bother
I’m peelin' off a knock for pots of hot water
Niggas wrote me off and it made me grind harder
Peace to the East, nigga peace to the chief
Got a slug for the judge, bringin' heat for police
And a book full of sins that I reap when I sleep
Then I wake up and I put em on a beat, how you love that?

Fuckin’ Up the Count Lyrics[Intro]
Eight?
Damn, Sarah, look, close your eyes (Yeah)
You working a ground stash, 20 tall pinks
Never fuckin' up the count
Two fiends come up to you and ask for two each
Another one cops three (Yeah) then Bodie hands you off 10 more
But some white guy rolls up in a car
Never fuckin' up the count
Waves you down and pays for the eight
How many vials you got left? (15)
Yeah, yeah, this for my young niggas
How the fuck you able to keep the count right
When you're not able to do the book problem man?
Count be wrong, they’ll fuck you up
Yeah, yeah

Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, ayy nigga
Time to whip these zippers in the kitchen with the same nigga
All I know is selling weed and water, dope and yay nigga
Money on my mind, don't do the crime unless it pay nigga
New 650 Bimmer coupe, I'm fucking in a foreign car
Got diamonds in my Rollie face, I'm bout to cop a Audemar
Top down on a bitch when I ride by, I feel like fuck the law
Got diamonds in my Rollie face, I'm bout to cop an Audemar
My celly steady ringin' for Freddie, where, where your bales at?
Teacher told me go get a job, I said "Where the scale at?"
Told my Cali plug wrap the package up, we can mail that
Teacher told me go get a job, I said, "Where the scale at?"

[Hook]
Bitch I'm straight ballin', fifty thousand dollars in a nigga couch
And never fucking up the count

And never fucking up the count
Bitch I'm straight ballin', fifty thousand dollars in a nigga couch

[Verse 2]
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, ayy nigga
Mama kick me out the house for servin' where she stay nigga
Nickel dimed and broke after I buy my brand new J's, nigga
Fuck this broke shit boy, went straight to robbing, what's the play nigga?
Ran off with this nigga, work is crucial when you burn a nigga
He might want that back so bitch you down to do a murder nigga
Used to keep that .45 on my front seat when I serve a nigga
Nigga want this work, I hope you down to do a murder, nigga
Celly steady ringin' for Freddie, where where the things at?
Drove a half a ton, dropped it off and I took a plane back
Gangsta shit in my DNA, I just can't explain that
Even if I die, tell my enemies I remain that

[Hook]
Said bitch I'm straight ballin', fifty thousand dollars in a nigga couch
And never fucking up the count
Bitch I'm straight ballin', 100 thousand dollars in my mama house

Bitch I'm straight ballin', tryna make a million 'fore they take me out
And never fucking up the count
Bitch I'm straight ballin', fifty thousand dollars in a nigga couch
And never fucking up the count

Yeah, gold crown
Top down as I cruise with a bad ho

She pop that pussy and rewind that
And suck a dick as I get twisted and listen to Do or Die rap
Freddie Kane, young Corleone
Hoppin' out the van with the bows of the strong
Nigga gettin' paid from the shit that I record
Hit my Lord wit' the pack when a nigga came home
Told my nigga we be smokin' and chokin', rollin', it's all the same
Druggin' and still thuggin', it's all a game
Real nigga 'bout to cash out
I need my rims on my cars when I pull them bitches off the lot

Bitches and palm trees, I'm on when I came here
Plug was up north, I pushed to the yay then
Shout out my niggas, I got a ton when the weight in
Feedin' my thugs, I'm pullin' dubs in the state pen
Fuckin' with Frederico Soprano
Niggas actin' monkey, my clip, I got a banana
Rollin' with guerillas, these niggas don't want no banter
I just might go flippin', go back and forth with them hammers
Nigga, we be smokin' and chokin', rollin', it's all the same
Druggin' and still thuggin', it's all a game
Full clip on the K thang
I got a shotty in the motherfuckin' trunk, nigga, don't get popped
[Pre-Hook]
Fuck the cops, bodies drop

But this thuggin' never stop, get that rock, what you thought?

4 Thangs Lyrics[Intro: Freddie Gibbs & Big Sean]
Quit playin' with me
Hit-Boy (Hol' up)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Freddie Gibbs]
She keep calling me babe, I said "That's not my name"
Million dollars, million followers, ho, that's not the same
And I just washed off the chicken, baby, that's not cocaine
Shit's so hot, you got two hundred, you can get like four thangs, yeah

[Verse: Freddie Gibbs, Big Sean & Both]
Gangsta G, gorilla pimp, stay with banana
I fuck with Sean Don, he run the D like Barry Sanders
Trophies, mantels, Billups, how shit get handled
I pray my life go over easy and I never scramble
She sent a text like "Can we talk?" Bitch, I'm not Tevin Campbell
I walk in, I'm deckin' it, makin' an entrance, I know where the exit is
We kick them hoes out, ain't no room service, we ain't bringing no breakfast in
Got an oval office in my house, bitch suck me off like a president
I'm talkin' Jefferson, Edison, Clinton
So much pussy, look like I'm sellin' it
And the polices know that I'm sellin' it
I did the one and the two with the heroin
And my nigga was snitchin', he tellin' it
I had to jump off a war with the Mexicans
Gotta get me a brand new plug
I run out of dope and I'm out of my element
Yeah, uh, bitch, Google my government, but that's not my name
Million dollars, million followers, ho, that's not the same
And I just washed off the chicken, baby, that's not cocaine, yeah
I give you the game, I don't play for the love of the game
Ho, I play for the rings
Every ho that I got is a side bitch
I ain't never gon' fuck on the main
Better Alex Trebek, I don't answer those questions
Jeopardize how far we done came
We are not one in the same, we can rock the same thing
And it won't look the same
These bitches, they want me to wife 'em, but I just one night 'em
Good bitches, they know me, it's all in my veins
[Chorus: Big Sean & Freddie Gibbs]
She keep calling me babe, I said "That's not my name"
Million dollars, million followers, ho, that's not the same
And I just washed off the chicken, baby, that's not cocaine
Shit's so hot, you got two hundred, you can get like four thangs, yeah

Hundred shells in this bitch, fifty shells in this bitch
Never tell in this bitch, fuck 12, suck a dick, fuck 12, suck a dick
Cutlass, all talk with the top off
Hit Diego, he gon' hit me with the drop-off
Tryna floss in the town, get you knocked off

Fuck a bad Insta bitch, Bunny Rabbit off the rip
Bunny Rabbit wrist is lit, Freddie Corleone, fuck 12, suck a dick

I'm glowin' 'cause a nigga straight
I'm happier than yesterday, we 'bout to beat the homie case
Tears on his daughter's face, just tryna help with what I make, ayy
Is it just feelings or rap lines?
Can't get wetty and baptized, no white man gon' save mine
A belt won't help my waistline, still gon' die for my groove line
Goddamn right, it's fuck one time
Way too Crip to go live, you take one, we take nine
We don't stop at stop signs
Might get fifty and that's fine, I just might pop, I keep tryin'
[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Every day I need a dope flip

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I’m still livin' like a dope dealer
And these streets they got no mercy on a broke nigga
Gangsta Island, so all my niggas gang bangers
Girls, come get your cook up
I came up with the 'cain slangers
And I grew up next door to the dopeman
Cherry red CL coupe clean as a coke can
DEA been doin' surveillance, they in the dope van
Nowadays they pay Walter Payton; that’s 34 bands
Yeah, I’m still livin' like a jack boy
Got your family wrapped up in tape, I’m 'bout the sack, boy
And I heard it ain’t where you from, it’s where you at, boy
Make sure every place that I’m at next to the strap, boy
Killin' them, shit from these verses put hoes in hearses
And these cluckers need some product
To purchase some at their service
Used to sale my yellow and nextel play for the chirpers
Ain’t no doubt, we don’t check out CTE
They close the curtains

[Hook]
And I’m still, still livin' like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger, I ain’t taking shit from no nigga
Still, I’m still livin' like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs, traffic what you know, boy
And I’m still, still livin' like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger, I ain’t taking shit from no nigga
Still, I’m still livin' like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs, traffic what you know, boy
[Verse 2]
Still cashing that dope check
Guns and contraband on deck
Street said that I'm marked for death
And might be the one to get smoked next
Might fuck around, might beat it down
That ass round and that throat wet
You a pussy boy, straight Kotex
Got a hundred rounds, bitch, hold that
Bitch, hold that, bitch, hold up
Bitch, know what? That 4 bust
Bought a 14 of that straight hard
And served every geeker that rolled up
That straight trap with no raps with me
OT, but they pack with me
Moonwalkin' on dope, bitch
I know real niggas on Jackson Street
25th, 49th, Cali kush over night
Come back to my store, dawg
But make sure you got your order right
And my shop might close up
So make sure you put your orders in
Just another day another dollar
Duckin' court again
Wrappin' up the pack of drugs, traffic watchin' out
Winter, summer, spring, fall
Nigga, shovel snow
And if I could I’d dig a tunnel straight to Mexico
Pass me my strap
I think the police at my door, because I’m…
[Hook]
And I’m still, still livin' like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger, I ain’t taking shit from no nigga
Still, I’m still livin' like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs, traffic what you know, boy
And I’m still, still livin' like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger, I ain’t taking shit from no nigga
Still, I’m still livin' like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs, traffic what you know, boy13Embed

20 Karat Jesus LyricsPart 1

[Intro]
Yeah, Kane
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
My ambitions as a rider, nigga, survival off that powder, nigga
Currently smokin' that kill in the hills where you can't find a nigga
Crack cocaine, microwave, dinner was on that timer, nigga
No sleep, bags under my eyes is designer, nigga
Blinded and misguided, nigga, Heavenly Father take the wheel
I'm on the interstate with some gorilla weight
Shit that can get me like 200 years
Duckin' the pen', I need forgiveness
I'm livin' like a every decision a sin
I know my niggas don't want me to win
Jealousy, choppin' off all of my friends
[Chorus]
I ride with that white-white, just like fight night we be weighin' in
VVS my pieces, 20 karat Jesus say amen
Tricked off on my new bitch, she was half black and Malaysian
Spent my last 200 thou' on a bird and a Mercedes Benz
My dog used to pull up in a '99 GS-300
Fresh up on the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
First these hoes ain't want it
Now they only here to Michael Jones it (Mike Jones!)
Mama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment

[Verse 2]
Now I-I-I-I be kickin' shit like Solange in the elevator
The goal when you try to kick that dope, stuck on the respirator
Got symptoms of withdrawal from the fall when I used to ball
I show you how in one summer one nigga could lose it all
Like why we gotta feel this pain and her friends and family don't?
My cellie like to walk around in his sleep, I rather stay woke
I must evoke, these are the results of the realest shit that I wrote
These hoes get in your ear and burn that ass quick like Galaxy Notes

[Chorus]
That's why I ride with that white-white, just like fight night we be weighin' in
VVS my pieces, 20 karat Jesus say amen
Tricked off on my new bitch, she was half black and Malaysian
Split my last two hundred thou' on a bird and Mercedes Benz
My dog used to pull up in a '99 GS-300
Fresh up off the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
First these hoes ain't want it
Now they only here to Michael Jones it (Mike Jones!)
Mama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment
[Verse 3]
I-I-I-I be kickin' shit just like Rodman did the camera man
I'm pure 100 dope like the poppy seed in Afghanistan
I been done dropped my nuts for this cabbage, hands do damage, nigga
Rips from the clip leave you stiff, Mannequin Challenge, nigga
Me and my chips with dip boy, ain't no play play 'bout that Frito-Lay
Tried to give me ten, I beat the case so it's gon' be okay
Fresh up on the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
Mama say I live next door to the death cause I live in the moment

[Outro]
Don't live in the moment
Don't live in the moment
I'll be there in the mornin'
Nigga, I'm livin' in the moment
I'll be there in the mornin'
I'll be there in the mornin'
I'll be there in the mornin'
Nigga, I'm livin' in the moment

Part 2

[Intro]
Yeah, Kane baby
I drink holy water
[Verse 1]
Quarter brick, half a brick, holy shit, whole shit
Scar across my face, strap on my shoulder on some Tony shit
Taught myself the streets, you know my pop ain't never taught me shit
'Cept, "Fuck a friend, you gon' be solo in your coffin, bitch"
Walkin' home from work, my .44 bulldog what I'm walkin' with
Old folks out the church say, "He need Jesus, that boy off a bit"
Preacher's daughter said, "I'll let you fuck, it just might cost a bit"
Type of shit a nigga been through make you dog a bitch
Lost a bitch, married these streets, she prenup, you can't divorce her
Lyin' from my cell, electrical tape on my tape recorder, sucker shit
Don't blow your money, young nigga, pay your lawyer
Niggas is wrapped in electrical tape, they walkin' tape recorders, yeah

[Break]
Yeah, bitch, your first motherfuckin' mixtape was a snitch tape
You ain't think I knew that shit though, I know though

[Verse 2]
Quarter brick, half a brick, holy shit, whole shit
Drove on 65, brought 65, I sold the whole shit
Po-po searched my Cutlass on the road, I got my Os hit
Boy you know the rules, they pick you up, don't call my phone bitch
Boy you know the rules, that shit don't jump unless you sold it down
S.W.A.T. team break, they cut the water off, can't flush the toilet down
454 my motor down, got green, got dog, got Yoda now
They playin' theyself for exposure now, this rappin' shit just for the posers now
The losers now
All these bitch niggas got videos up with their toolies out
Everybody flashin' real money
Niggas card crackin', gettin' Visa money
I don't knock it, I just do the dope and blow it
I gotta get it so I gotta see the money
Y'all remember peacin' out 28th
To get the blunt liquor and a piece of money, young nigga

[Break]
Young nigga
Stay smooth, stay solid, nigga
These niggas'll put your name in everythin' but a prayer, amen

[Outro: Slink Johnson]
Glory be to God, what's happening, pimps?
It is I, the alpha and omega, the original righteous player
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
It's your boy Jesus, man
Yes my nigga, Jesus is your homeboy
Hahahahahah
Say it again so I can uh reiterate it, man
Your minds not ready and your heart's not open
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's what's wrong with you, man
You doin' all that covetin'
You tryin' to, you-you-you wan't what other niggas got
You not even just payin' attention to your gift, nigga
God gave you a gift, nigga
Pay attention to what he got for you
You, other niggas over here
Yeah, he could sell dope real good, that's not your lane, my nigga
God gave you hands, you a chef my nigga
Chef up that boysenberry crème brûlée, man7Embed

Big Boss Rabbit Lyrics[Intro: Mike Tyson]
There's never any doubts in my mind
Because I'm the best in the world
Even though a lot of you don't like to hear that
I just, it's facts, I'm the best, you know what I mean?
I, sometimes, I don't wanna believe in myself
But it's the truth, I'm the best
And I'm just convinced, you know what I mean?
These fellas, how dare them challenge me
With their somewhat primiti-primitive skills
They're just as good as dead

Slammin', big MAC-11, back of the sevеn on some boss shit (Yeah)

Step out with your lady, shoot some babies on the Maybelline (Yeah)
And overdose the stroller, cut the co-co with the ketamine (Sh)
Dope and ibuprofen in my bowl, I got them recipes (Skrrt)
Boss shit, shoot it like Steph, I just hit the three and I wasn't even lookin'
Your favorite rapper just hit the stage, well, bitch, we 'bout to book 'em
Bitches in love with us, keep the pussy, I just keep it pushin' (Yeah)
My baby momma's knew the job was crooked before they took it (Bitch)
Kane Train reckless, bitch, we runnin' shit
Just touched down in the airport, Louis V backpack full of them hundreds, bitch (Yeah)
Cleaner than McQueen, ho, I'm a gangster, not no lover, bitch (Yeah-yeah)
Grammy afterparty bitch, we rock it like we won it, bitch (Yeah)

[Chorus]

No Hot 100, I'm a hot boy with some murder ones (Yeah, yeah)
Cash money Kane, big number one Sunday, you my youngest son (Yeah, yeah)
See my first crackhead like that Bimmer back in '91 (Bitch)
And I been on the blaze since 2Pac was rockin' the Gumby fade (Yeah)
Fuckin' up my cup with this Activis like some lemonade
Bitches big B-L, if you violate, you're a renegade
Know trigger fingers, ain't have to type on your Twitter page (Yeah, yeah)
Freddie Krueger, P-90 Ruger, I'm keepin' on 'em (Yeah)
Niggas say they ain't losin' sleep, tell 'em, "I'm sleepin' on 'em" (Bitch)
Got heavy traffic, the neighbors might call the people on 'em (Yeah, yeah)
Surround your car with ARs, I put the reaper on 'em
Death wish, reach 'em with that automatic shotty, that's a death kiss
Niggas be pullin' through, so I aim above the neck, bitch
Fly with it on me, I got my blicky on the jet, bitch
Ready to set it off and I put that on the set, bitch (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Boss shit, big MAC-11, back of the seven on some boss shit (Yeah)
I put that President on my wrist and I got frostbit (Brr)
Stack it like Pringles, you want a single? It's gon' cost you (Bitch)
CEO rabbit, young Freddie Kane, I'm on some boss shit (Yeah)
Big MAC-11, back of the seven on some boss shit (Brrat)
I put that President on my wrist and I got frostbit (Brrat)
Stack it like Pringles, you want a single? It's gon' cost you (Bitch)
Pull up to your funeral, man, shoot up your fuckin' coffin (Brrt)

How We Do (’93 Til Freestyle #3) Lyrics[Intro: Freddie Gibbs + woman]
Yeah
Still too cool to love these hoes
All I wanna do is fuck these hoes
Still too cool to love these hoes
All I wanna do is fuck these hoes


[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Once upon a time round '99
I took a chick to the prom with a big behind
She had a cute face, a thin waist, a bright smile
Titties mediocre, but ass was like, blaow
Might have been two thou' when I met that ho
But on the low I used to sweat that ho, I had to let that go
Cause baby had me with a hell of a crush
Love letters on her locker, I ain't give no fuck
What other niggas thought about me
Cause I was all about we, me and her 'til I D-I-E
Made me want to do some shit like carve her name in a tree
Like we was K-I-S-S-I-N-G
But little did I know she had a dude
With hella money, hella jewels, I was just another nigga in school
A straight fool, for thinking I was special or different
Lost my respect for the rest of the bitches
I played hoes and shank hoes for bankrolls
Never thought they'd fill my heart with pain though
I would laugh when a broad made my niggas feel blue
But the jokes ain't funny when the joke's on you
Let me stroke something boo, let me get that pearl
Touch your softest spot, let me in your world
And you can be his girl, and that nigga can remain your man
Freddie G'll be your back-up plan
[Hook] x2
It’s how we do
Cause why have one when a nigga can have two
Three or four hoes I like the ass brand new
Just fuck with me and ill stay true
“I love you"
Yea yea I love you too

It's how we do, do, do-do-do
It's how we do, do, do-do-do
It's how we do, do, do-do-do

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I had a bad bitch from Nap named Nicole
Nicole used to keep a nigga dick on swole
She knew I had a girlfriend, but she love my pole
And when she saw me with my woman, then she lost control
And went crazy, "Freddie I can't believe you played me
People told me that niggas from the G was shady
You forgot you didn't wear a rubber when you laid me
I'm pregnant and it's your baby"
Hell of a bind, these hoes put me through a hell of a time
Met a girl last year that I thought was mine
Came all the way to NY to see me rhyme
Flew her ass out to LA for Christmas time
And shit was fine, we on the same beat
She ain't got a problem with me being in the street
I know I ain't her one and only, but I'm hoping I ain't one of many
Baby pretty, but try to play me silly, cause she really
Wasn't think 'bout religion when she told me the dick bomb
But then she up and left me cause I practice Islam
I guess Mom told her that the boy ain't right
And she gon' pray to Jesus Christ to take me out of her life
And out of her sight, she keep it undercover
I really used to mean it when I told her that I love her
But now I know that love is a four letter word
Like fuck and shit
So love you can suck my dick11Embed

Forever and a Day Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, bitch
(I'ma make it even if it take forever and a day now)
I done did a lot of, yeah
I done did a lot of, yeah, yeah
(I'ma make it even if it take forever and a day now)

[Bridge]
I done did a lot of bad things just to get change
I done took it to some levels that a lot of niggas won't go, yeah
(I'ma make it even if it take forever and a day, now)
I done did a lot of bad things just to get change
I done took it to some levels that a lot of niggas won't go, yeah
(I'ma make it even if it take forever and a day, now)

[Verse 1]
I done did a lot of bad things just to get change
I done took it to some levels that a lot of niggas won't go
Take a life just to get a name
Came up with the crackheads, thugs and the cut-throats
Bloodshot from the blunt smoke
Man I'm so high that I can't even look my own momma in the eyes
Kicked out through the front door
She said the way a nigga livin', if I die, she won't be surprised
Tears on the Bible, she prayed for me
This can't be the life that she made for me
Got her lying to police when they raid for me
If there's a Heaven, will they open up the gates for me?
I wanted money for the summer, make a nigga trunk knock
Gang signs out the window, screamin' out, "Fuck cops"
Soft dope, hard dope, get it all one stop
Slung crack rock, never had a wicked jump shot, yeah
Middle school, it was no joke
Hats broke to the right in the hall, it was all Folks
Little Lord had to lay low
Had a .38, I kept it in my locker, you ain't even know
I wasn't from their hood so the Westside niggas
They ain't really have no reason to respect a nigga
And since I went to school with them motherfuckers
Niggas from my hood actin' like they ain't accept a nigga
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Can't forget it, don't regret it, gave a nigga somethin' to rap about
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Last real nigga standing, I'm the one you niggas rap about, yeah
[Hook]
Fuck what niggas say now
I'ma make it even if it take forever and a day now
No games, can't play now
If I see you at the top, will I see you on the way down?
Fuck what a nigga say now
I'ma make it even if it take forever and a day now
No games, can't play now
If I see you at the top, will I see you on the way down?
Yeah, will I see you on the way down?
Yeah, I'ma feel it from the waist down
Yeah, I'ma see you on the way down
Yeah, bet I feel it from the waist down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, keep your head up nigga
Yeah, I know you fed up nigga
Yeah, so get your bread up nigga
Where the club? We can tear it up nigga, yeah
Pop a bottle of that Ace, take it to the dome
Free my nigga Will Scrill', bring that nigga home
Yeah, I did it for the hood, now a nigga known
Fuck rap, dope game put a nigga on
Dope game, rap game got a nigga stressed
Heavy smokin', heavy drinkin', runnin' through a check
Got me trippin', diamonds drippin' off a nigga neck
Runnin' through a hundred bitches, who I'm doin next?
And my girl at the crib got her own
She don't need a dog nigga like that
It be a hole in my motherfuckin' soul
If see another nigga wife that
Don't like that but it's like that
Steady tryin to keep my cool in a game full of fake niggas
Backstabbin' and snake niggas
Do a song with you, talk about you, smile in your face niggas
Shouts out to the nigga Snow
We was tryna take the world just like Tony and Manolo
But he shot me at the front door
He ain't want to see another nigga happy, that's a no-no
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Can't forget it, don't regret it, gave a nigga somethin' to rap about
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Last real nigga standing, I'm the one you niggas rap about, yeah
[Hook]
Fuck what niggas say now
I'ma make it even if it take forever and a day now
No games, can't play now
If I see you at the top, will I see you on the way down?
Fuck what a nigga say now
I'ma make it even if it take forever and a day now
No games, can't play now
If I see you at the top, will I see you on the way down?
Yeah, will I see you on the way down?
Yeah, I'ma feel it from the waist down
Yeah, I'ma see you on the way down
Yeah, bet I feel it from the waist down

Nigga tryin to bust them down
But I done fucked around and got an O of loud with no swishers
Whats up?
Roll some, smoke some, let me poke some
Man I got up in that pussy like four somethin'
When the clock struck five I was in the ride
Five thirty she was already on my line
Sayin what about breakfast, but a nigga like me too restless
Got a lot of money on my checklist
Talkin to my OG niggas in Texas he said
This game so dirty, gotta roll around with my thirty
And I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried
He said this game so dirty, gotta roll around with my thirty
And I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried

Now if people talking bout you then know you're doing things
They ask about my song, they like the way I screw it man
Hey, these bitches boppin, man these nigga coppin
Man I feel like every label in the world just signed me
Yeah I'm from the bottom, when we sip drink and we poppin pills

One think about it, say one think about it

Sellin dope in the snow til my toes froze

Crushed Glass Lyrics[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, yeah
Diego, roll me one up, my nigga
Yeah, yeah, Kane, yeah

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
The future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
I admit that I was timid at a younger age, nigga
Daddy asked me what I wanna be, I said, "A paid nigga"
Whippin' extras out the pot, I gave myself a raise, nigga
Heaven sent, I can't remember the last time I prayed, nigga
So the Devil introduced me to cookin' cocaine, nigga
On the blade, seven days, ain't bathe or shave, nigga
I was, thuggin' with my trey-eight
Motherfuck a president, I got a Presidential Day-date
I run a check up like a Chase bank
The police open up the package if your shipment come a day late
I just beat a rape case—groupie-bitch I never fucked
Tried to give me ten for some pussy that I never touched
At a certain level, system tried to test a nigga's nuts
Nigga hire like eleven lawyers—had to level up, yeah
[Chorus: Brittany B & Freddie Gibbs]
Living this life, just me, myself and I
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
If I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
Living this life, just me, myself and I
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
And if I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
The future started yesterday nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
Had a baby, now my daughter gettin' up in age, nigga
When I die, I bet she say, "My daddy was a paid nigga"
'Round the world, jail system like a slave trade, nigga
Got me in this foreign prison, monkey in a cage, nigga
Bail paid, locked me up for an extra 30 days, nigga
Barely let us use the shower, ain't bathed or shaved, nigga
I was, sittin' in a cell missin' show dates
Commissary late, I'm postin' pictures with the toothpaste
Barely eat the food, stress'll make a nigga lose weight
Enter the mental of a nigga that wish he knew his fate
Shit these bitches do to try to get your cash
Erica visit, can't wipe her tears from behind the glass
Choppin' the porcelain up for years, said I'm suckin' glass
I beat the DEA and the task, now I'm on my ass
Future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
Donald Trump gon' chain us up and turn back to slaves, nigga
Got the recipe for dope, my reparations paid, nigga
Feel like that at some point, really I should feel ashamed, nigga
They kill us, we killin' us, but that is not the way, nigga
Money tree up in the stripper club, I'm throwin' shade, nigga
Did destruction on your flow when I paved the lane, nigga
Chest to chopper, blow your chest out, where your heart at, nigga?
Black Tony, Babyface, better scar that nigga
Sent the hit out, I'm just waitin' on the call back, nigga
Shoot them pussies, burn it up, don't bring the car back, nigga
Gangsta G, I fucked the industry, them crackers say I'm too aggressive
I turned myself into a boss without a fuckin' question
Six whips, ghetto nigga gotta be excessive
I came up on fried bologna, boy, what you expected?
What you expected?
[Chorus: Brittany B & Freddie Gibbs]
Living this life, just me, myself and I
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
If I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
Living this life, just me, myself and I
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
And if I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)

[Outro: Brittany B]
Ooh, I will be alright
Ooh, I will live my life
Ooh, I will be alright
Ooh, I will live my life
Living this life, just me, myself and I
If I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
Living this life, just me, myself and I
If I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright19Embed

Alexys Lyrics[Intro]
Kane, nigga, on the blade
I think, I think niggas forgot who, you know, who gave
Who gave these niggas this flow, you know what I'm sayin'?
Baby Scarface

[Verse 1]
I first tasted cocaine in 10th grade
Homie at the table choppin' Rick James
Sent the package off from Texas, it's been six days
Keep it sweatin' like a pig until that bitch came
Nigga had to keep a job, livin' off in my momma's spot
Fuck it, I'ma bust a fuckin' jugg, I'm a juggernaut
Pop a zone and drop it off in that water, we was cookin' out
Loud packs and molly powder all these niggas pushin' out
Feds lookin', cause I peddled paint to these poor folks
The realest niggas that I know ain't never sold dope
The hardest niggas that I know ain't never served time
Soon as I got me thirty thousand, I hit the bird line
And I brought that dog back to the set, niggas know me for that
Shout out to my niggas from D.C. with them scorpion packs
Keep this strictly business, you can't mix up your homie with that
One day you might have to clap a nigga, no glory in that
Feel like I'm outgrowin' all my friends, niggas thinkin' small
Gon' have to write them all a check, just to get the shit resolved
Then turn right back around and write them another one when they trick it off
Get successful and watch how quickly niggas get in their feelings, dawg
Get successful and watch how you immediately become their competition
Niggas worse than a side bitch, they can't quite stay in a position
Don't know what niggas crave more, money or a-fuckin-ttention
And these the niggas I'm cool with, my enemies I have yet to mention
[Chorus]
I got cake, bitch, everyday be my birthday
You can't take me, I'm first place on my worst day
Streets dry, niggas thirsty, so I pray that when they come and take me
That this mini Draco make the earth shake
Have a nigga on some "underneath the earth"shit
My nigga Shermie caught a murder on his first lick
These animalistic instincts that we was born with
Felt so pimpish when Alexys put me in the foreign whip
Black as hell but rap got me thinkin' I need a foreign bitch
Takin' my black queens for granted, got me ignorin' them

[Verse 2]
Names I be callin' her, nigga know you be doggin' her
What kind of man is you to you little niece and yo' daughter and 'em?
I’m posted at the stove with that yola, that soda lockin' in
Ving Rhames guns and butter, niggas get margarine
Pussy niggas can't play they part, we dearly departed them
Quick like OJ Simpson, you Bart, Homer, and Marge and 'em
I rap but I keep weight, and I know the streets take
Niggas out the game, my baby momma told me be safe
Turned around and said, "Fuck safe, I stay dangerous"
In the set with Sodi, no chopper, my chain danglin'
In the set with Deuce, I be Bloodin', we gang gangin' 'em
My nigga Corleone and Diego, they smash craniums
Livin' life on high speed, nigga, that's just the lane we in
'Bout to cop a Porsche from that the packet that Freddie Kane gettin'
[Chorus]
I got cake, bitch, everyday be my birthday
You can't take me, I'm first place on my worst day
Streets dry, niggas thirsty, so I pray that when they come and take me
That this mini Draco make the earth shake
Have a nigga on some "underneath the earth" shit
My nigga Shermie caught a murder on his first lick
These animalistic instincts that we was born with

Rob Me A Nigga Lyrics[Hook - Big K.R.I.T.]
Rob me a nigga
Rob me a, rob me a nigga
Cause the bills too high, this nigga right here too fly
And right now I might just rob me a nigga

[Verse 1 - Freddie Gibbs]
The liquor got me lurking and looking for a lame nigga
To set up for my next lick
In the Chevy, about to roll up the stress, with a Tec
And what he got on his neck, got him a death wish
It's kinda funny cause he used to be my nigga tho
We was breaking bread, flipping bricks like a year ago
Shit can get into a nigga's head when his digits low
Make you wanna send one of your friends to his funeral
Maybe me and him was never friends in the first place
Don't mean a thing cause we share the same birthplace
Same city, same hood, but we down to kill each other for a dollar
Cause we want it in the worst way
Money talk and bullshit gon walk a marathon
And I ain't scared of getting killed cause I'm getting mine
And if they ever try to raid, I'mma hit the fuckin pigs with the K's
I ain't tryna do a lick of time
Spend all my last money, the bills too high
His jewelry, his whip game, the wheels too fly
I'm thinking about murder every time we cruise by
Heard he got like 84 elbows of blue fire
In the basement, muthafuckas still think basic
Thinkin' I'mma show up and erase 'em, but I ain't gonna chase 'em
I'mma be up in his crib waiting
"Bitch where the cash? I can taste it"
Put em on their faces: what you know about kidnapping
And holding a nigga's whole family for ransom?
When your stomach empty it's easy to understand it
Got me out here taking them penitentiary chances
"Born in this world of tears, will die laughing"
Put that on the headpiece right above my casket
Still in the game, my batteries still lastin
Bout to put some gas up in my Caprice Classic, and...
[Hook- Big K.R.I.T.]
Rob me a nigga
Rob me a, rob me a nigga
Bills too high, this nigga right here too fly
Right now I might just rob me a nigga

[Verse 2 - Alley Boy]
As I look at the charm, thinking of a strong arm
Seen his watch as he reachin for his car alarm
Bet this hundred round drum pussy nigga thinkin twice
Fore he try to run, shots spit, and the cops come
All they seen was my golds and a black mask
Throw the car round the corner, tinted up with no tags
All these niggas wanna flash, Ima put it to they ass
With the K out, ask a nigga, “Where da sack at?"
Give it here, you wanna die for that rolex?
You can either get your life or that watch back
Ima shoot you point blank, I’m just hoping you think
You can take it as a loss, you can get it back
Nigga, buck and get shot, that’s the street code
I’m leave you there, do you, that’s how the shit go
Just another episode, A-K explode
In his head, left a smoke hole
Be a shamed if you died over fake shit
But that’s a lesson, if you out here on some fake shit
Come and robbin everyday, know the young nigga hungry
They be murkin for a quarter brick
Know they kill a whole fam for the whole thang
All the shooters up in Gary on the same thang
All the little homies strapped, so they look plain
Gun shots rang out, nigga, see flames
We be takin so much, now the shit fun
We be lookin for your shit fore your shit come
Forty eight hours, nigga round my way
Everyday nigga lookin like a sitcom
In this game of lose or draw nigga
You can be the one that get robbed
Or be the one to rob a nigga
But we all gotta eat, so we get no sleep
We gon wait it out and kill a nigga4Embed

Eastside Moonwalker Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lifestyles of the insane
Eastside thug nigga, I'm the shit, you a shit stain
I let the boxframe switch lanes
Not a pretty nigga, but I got some game for a bitch brain
And I lay it on so thick
Charge it all to a broad, heard a pimp nigga quote this
And I'm allergic to a broke bitch
I think I need my medicine, I had to po' up 'fore I wrote this
And doing dirty keep a nigga with a deep pocket
Dope fiends and the cluckheads keep shopping
Steady praying that the yayo keep locking
Keep a strap cause the jackboys keep robbing
Got me pulling up slow
Whip another clip and put my pedal to the floor
Slamming Cadillac doors, working wood like a pro
Ass sit on nothing but that leather, whatcha know, how you living, nigga?
Lifestyles of the insane
Roll the kill, pop a pill, crack a seal, I resist pain
Niggas looking for that big stain
Dirt weed, dog food, fye kush, niggas flip 'caine
Think I lost my religion
Stepping on a pack, break 'em off in the kitchen
Chevy topped off with the chrome in the engine
Niggas gotta floss, that's the cost of this pimping, I'ma pull up slow
[Hook]
I'ma pull up slow
Candy paint dripping from my Cadillac door
I'ma pull up slow, I'ma pull up slow
Run up with the mask, put them hoes on the floor
I'ma pull up slow, I'mma pull up slow
Run up with the mask, put them hoes on the floor
I'ma pull up slow, I'ma pull up slow
Candy paint dripping from my Cadillac door
I'ma pull up slow

[Verse 2]
It's the muddy cup moonwalker, nightstalker
Motherfucking white chalker, might've caught ya
In the streets with your pants down
Tell 'em call the paramedics, nigga man down, ease up
If you thugging, get your Gs up
And never fake, never fraud, never fold, never freeze up
A black mask, black tee'd up
The motherfucking dope game feed us, how you living, nigga?
And rest in peace to my motherfucking homeboy
But hold your tears, he ain't die, he just a fuckboy
You might as well be a dead man in my eyes
2-2-3, sucker-free when I ride
Freddie Kane, Freddie Corleone
Selling things to the smokers in the mobile homes
A pack of backwoods, dirty styrofoam, and a pocket full of stones
And my Cadillac Brougham, I'ma pull up slow

The Hard Lyrics[Intro: Dana Williams]
I know that life is short
But we can't move too fast

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Hit the block, dressed in white, straight Bo Jackson Nikes
Call my partner Mike, copped a pint, pour four in my Sprite
55 a line, that's aight cause I'm 'bout that life
Pussy on my mind, bitch you tired, it's that mouth tonight
Weed and waffles in the morning
Downtown Chicago, smoking on some shit that I imported
MDMA light up her day, sometimes she like to snort it
And shit was too dry with that Tony, bitch now I'm reloaded
Bitch I'm reloaded
And I'm chopping up the hard, dopeboy I play my part
Fuck with the gangsta type, ain't got no stripes, then you's a mark
Smoking Carolina Blue fresh out the Carolina Park
So much gunplay in the day, just might be safer in the dark
And this Glock ain't got no safety, the owner ain't got no patience
So please don't make my finger and this trigger make relations
Said this Glock ain't got no safety, straight make yo ass a patient
Guess I'll slang until my grave or take that federal vacation
Nigga, nigga
[Pre-Hook: Dana Williams]
I know that life is short
But we can't move too fast

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
These niggas want it so I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These niggas say they want it so I'm chopping up the hard
Said I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These geekers say they on it so I'm chopping up the hard, nigga

[Bridge: Freddie Gibbs]
Whip the crack, dressed in black, just picked up a pack
Feeling great, dropped some 28s, got 'em jumping back
Jumping up, what the fuck, G.I. they don't fuck with us
Most these niggas out the Mid wouldn't breathe until I bust a nut

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Rob a nigga father figure, dope house was my college nigga
Plus my part time job didn't make no dollars, I'm a water whipper
See through you like windows, basis of your heart is artificial
Mob of hungry niggas like we came straight out of Mogadishu
What's the issue? Stack full of pancakes and my pistol
Shit official, when you see a police, nigga hit that whistle
They out to get you, so fuck all my opponents
They can peel me off this corner cause I know these niggas want it
[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
These niggas want it so I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These niggas say they want it so I'm chopping up the hard
Said I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These geekers say they on it so I'm chopping up the hard, nigga

[Verse 3: Dana]
I know that life is short
(Life's short, know what I'm saying, you gotta get moving, know what I mean)
But we can't move too fast
(Know what I'm saying, I ain't tryna run a race or no shit like that, you know)
Cause if we go right now
(Nigga just tryna get out here and chop, chop it up and get mine, you know
Piece of the pie)
It will never last
In the morning
When the sun comes up
And everything is cold
It's a new day
And all of it is beautiful
Or so I thought

[Freddie Gibbs]
Just let me make it to another morning
Just let me make it to another morning
Just let me make it to another morning
Just let me make it to another morning
[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
These niggas want it so I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These niggas say they want it so I'm chopping up the hard
Said I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These geekers say they on it so I'm chopping up the hard, nigga7Embed

Vice Lord Poetry Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro]
Yeah, uh
Dropped somethin' off real quick, you know what I’m sayin'?
Yeah (Uh, triple S), bitch

[Verse 1]
I was big rabbit before the birth of my son
The Earth ain’t big enough for both of us, you gotta get done
They sayin' they smoking top fives
But you ain't burned up the one (Skrrt)
Uh, fuck niggas talkin' 'bout? (Fuck niggas talkin' 'bout?)
Like every time I hit the booth
I don't leave that bitch with a body count
Came up talkin' shit as a toddler, I had a potty mouth (Yeah)
All the girls I ever got pregnant I trick the body out
Lift that ass up, got them titties did
Got rich and didn't die tryin', fuck all the many men
Got rich and put 'em on tour, shoutout my mini-mes (Yeah)
Only thing they own is them diamond Cubans and skinny jeans (Hahaha) Only thing I got is my balls and my word if anything
Hoes will be with any crew, give that ass to any who
Got they credibility wanin' just like these rappers do (Yeah)
Niggas change they name but your history ain't detachable
I'm so grammatical I could take a sabbatical (Yeah)
Gary nigga was never no Indianimal (Yeah)
Built the empire from ashes and send me back a few (Yeah)
Niggas wanna sign me off, I'm the reason they signing you
[Bridge]
(Hahaha, bitch, you know what I'm sayin'?)
You wanna cut the Kane train, nigga
I'm the motherfuckin' blueprint, nigga
You got the carbon copy, bitch, yeah

[Verse 2]
Fuck the industry, you get lost in it (Yeah)
BET treat a nigga like I ain't dark-skinned (Fuck)
But I ain't fuck with y'all since 106 & Park ended
Cypher's just a waste of my time 'cause I walk the park with it
Snow said: "Let's hit the awards," but we ain't dressin' up
Showed up in a tank top and chucks, he in a fuckin' tux
Textin' Ross to get some advice, he keep me buttoned up
I disrespected bro several years ago, I was fuckin' up (Yeah)
Now I love him like my momma son
House up in the hills ain't shit 'til you get your momma one
You a certified crack baby, I ganked your momma funds
Pray the Lord forgive me for selling dope during Ramadan, uh
Duha keep a nigga stable
Them crackers mark a nigga grave before you touch the cradle
I sent a ton off to the Moes 'cause I was more than able (Feen)
They let the GDs in the door, the Lords was at the table (Feen)

[Bridge]
(Triple S exercise) You know I'm sayin', nigga
Big rabbit, not lil rabbit
Lil rabbit with the babysitter, bitch
You know what I'm sayin'?
You gotta deal with the big boy
(I can already feel my trappin' mojo returnin')
[Part II]

[Verse 3]
Uh, yeah
Rest in peace Big Time, nigga
You know what I'm sayin', nigga? (Broadway)
That private school shit is expensive (Triple S)
Ayo, roaches on my cereal boxes, in Gary living poor
Same meal Saturday morning, we watchin' Diff'rent Strokes
Diego shakin' up with me, Ced and them niggas flippin folks
I was sellin' dope when Kanye was workin' at River Oaks (Yeah, yeah)
I did it with no radio
Had a million dollars before I ever met Ebro (Yeah)
'Cause up until this point my activities was illegal (Yeah)
I never made a chart, I ain't let it fuck with my ego (Fuck a ego)
What I drop spark fear
I had the album of the year, bitch, you can ask Nasir
The gangsta rapper of the year runnin' like ten years straight
Sometimes I feel like all my flowers comin' ten years late (That's how I feel, bitch)
But fuck it (That's how I feel, nigga)
Vice Lord poetry (Yeah)
Had to be twice as nice as these niggas for y'all to notice me
King Rabbit, nobody over me
If I had a time machine
The younger Fred would be buying bricks from the older me
If I had a time machine I would bring Chad Butler back
Candy painted, sitting on blades, so how you lovin' that?
Oh, you lovin' that?7Embed

Automatic Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, we gon' twerk these motherfuckin' numbers
Oh yeah, just 'gon spit on this shit
Whippin' that Richard Pryor
I don't got shit to prove, you know what I'm sayin'?
Old head niggas ratted, rat ass niggas
I was in the kitchen choppin' blade
(Whoa Kenny!)
You know what I'm sayin', nigga? (Skrrt)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, whippin' that Richard Pryor
Chicken comin' in soft get it hard fried
I just came through porsche'd out with the frog eyes
Got that Afghani dope with the mob ties
Pop the Glock at yo top, throw the Glock away
Beat the cake just like Ikey beat Anna Mae
I don't got shit for a pussy ass nigga
But white shit and yellow tape
I don't got shit for a pussy ass nigga
But knuckles and hollow tips
I just put my monkey nuts on my chopper stick
Might just knock of an arm when that chopper hits
Front my cousin the pack and he just lost a brick
Cut that nigga off like he a naggin' bitch
Got my house and my whip and your bitch
And this drip on my neck and my wrist off that powder shit
[Chorus]
Benz fully automatic, chopper fully automatic
She gon' suck me off, it's automatic
You can wife the ho cause I done had it
And I ain't never had a OG, most them old heads niggas ratted
Carolina Park Kane train, I'm the Big Lord Bunny Rabbit
Benz fully automatic, chopper fully automatic
She gon' suck me off, it's automatic
You can wife the ho cause I done had it
And I ain't never had an OG, most them old heads niggas ratted
All the young niggas know me, and the gang gang got it tatted

[Verse 2]
Gang gang got it tatted
Set name got it tatted
Yayo got me fuckin' with the matics
Finna wrap this crack up in the plastic
Sent your bitch to shop in London
Seven-hour flight, the ho ain't bring no baggage
Street sweeper got a heatseeker
Push a pussy nigga off the planet (on God)
Oh God, show you niggas how to rob
I can shoot a nigga in the face and make the bond
Knock him out his Louboutins
Over 500 degrees when I cook a nigga
Fuck polices
I go on the run 'fore I just let 'em book a nigga
Cop that new GTR or Porsche
That's the garage on you pussy niggas
[Chorus]
Benz fully automatic, chopper fully automatic
She gon' suck me off, it's automatic
You can wife the ho 'cause I done had it
And I ain't never had a OG, most them old heads niggas ratted
All the young niggas know me and the gang gang got it tatted
Benz fully automatic, chopper fully automatic
She gon' suck me off, it's automatic
You can wife the ho cause I done had it
And I ain't never had a OG, most them old heads niggas ratted
All the young niggas know me, and the gang gang got it tatted5Embed

Black Illuminati Lyrics[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Slammin', used to sleep on the floor with a Kel-Tec
Got a bag I can't bag yet because it's still wet
Repo man, I pay him a visit, ain't paid his bills yet
Brain hemorrhage, blunt-force trauma, I make him feel that
I wrap and seal that
Sent out the bricks that had the Nike Swoosh stamps, I'm just doin' it for the camp
Nigga showed 'em to the plug, now he shoppin' behind my back, uh
One thing about that bitch karma, she comin' back
If you trappin', keep a strap close
Nowadays, this shit became a trend to snake your homies out 'cause everybody backdoor
But everybody Black, though
I let the fiends catch a bean, usеd to vomit off the secondhand crack smoke
Nigga got that PTSD from tеstin' the key
Gums numb, hope I didn't purchase work from the F-E-Ds
'Cause every time I see the judge, it's like a scary movie
Fuck the court, real nigga can't do no jury duty
Internet done altered this shit through a different game now
I don't rap about dead opps, I let his name die
Shame how they blackball Kane, they scratched my name out
I pushed it longer than I expected to get my name hot
[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
They wanna take me out this game like Sha'Carri
Black Illuminati, touch Big Rabbit, streets need a body
I got all of them leeches away from 'round me
You ain't rich enough to get me hit, pussy, go up the bounty, uh

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Spend some cheese, bitch, chopper sing, bitch
Brew him up, had him huggin' them EMTs, bitch
Turn the witness to Stevie Wonder, ho, you ain't seen shit
Youngins on a mando' slide, this shit routine, bitch
Delta 88 with a cool knot in my tube socks
Now I push the goons through the boondocks in the Countach
Penthouse in the city, my bops givin' me rooftop
Told 'em free my nigga G-Weeder, ho, let the Whoops out
You feel my energy, they gon' remember me
Ain't never had a friend like me, your enemy my enemy
Lambo crashed the whip and got plates in both shoulders
If he didn't live through that accident, this shit could've been over, yeah

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
They wanna take me out this game like Sha'Carri
Black Illuminati, afghan doggy straight off the poppy
I ain't trust him, had to dust him like Christopher Moltisanti
And it hurt my heart to hurt you, but nigga, streets need a body, yeah
I don't house these hoes, bitch, get a hobby
She ain't workin', then you ain't got a wifey, you got a Tommie, yeah
I got all of them leeches away from 'round me
Bulletproof the Escalade, I got iron like Robert Downey, nigga, yeah
[Interlude: Freddie Gibbs & Jadakiss]
Fuck you lil' niggas (Uh)
(Triple-S exercise)
Kane
Kiss, haha
It's what we do, nigga

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I don't do the Chrome Heart, I just do the home art
You can catch a headshot or you can catch a dome dart
Go ahead and put the kids to sleep, this the grown part
'Fore we knew what Billboard was, we had our own chart
Strapped and they pull the car over, you take your own charge (Take that)
I ain't never worked for nobody, I sold my own hard (That's right)
Smoke a fat one in the back right in my own yard
Playin' dominoes with my man, he in the boneyard
Now I can pay for the jet right on my own card
Niggas tryna go man on me, I'm in the zone, God
Hand-to-hand with it, I ain't never played the phone, God
Calisthenics and cardio, just tryna tone, God (That's it)
Your man got the semi, but he ain't poppin'
My youngin got the bricks in the hemi, and he ain't stoppin'
Lil' extra in the beginning to get him coppin' (Uh-huh)
He ain't worried, 'cause if they get him, I get him Cochran (I got him)
He know not to fuck with them bitches, they get him hot then (He know)
Stay low, finish the work, he get a drop Benz (Yeah)
They just wanna be around money, but they are not friends (Nah)
Until you fall back from 'em, that's where the plot ends (Yeah)
I've been reppin' the Apple since it was rotten (Mmh)
When you a G.O.A.T., then you can never be forgotten (Never)
They gotta ram it, you don't ever let the cops in (Never)
I can have your funeral in the top ten (Woo)
A lot of niggas are nice, but they are not him (Jada)
It's really nothing that you can do to stop him (Hater)
Call him the god MC just like Rakim (Woo)
And he done took some L's, but yeah, he got wins
Motherfucker2Embed
