One of Those Nights Lyrics[Intro: The Weeknd]
Hey, I'ma visit the sky today
Hey, I'ma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just 'cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'm tryna sink in some gin
I need, I need, I need, I need, I need
And all this Hennessy got niggas in here hatin' on me
On me, on me, on me
But if the neighbors know my name then, then I'm doin' somethin' right
And if their mamas know my name
And if their homies know my name then
Then I'm doing something right
And if their girlfriends know my name
And just 'cause she loves me, don't mean she understands
I don't give a damn, I'll make her fuck the band, ooh, yeah
I love the guitars
I already know, I've seen her at my show banging out XO all day
And her friend's a freak
She can't feel her throat, no, she can't feel her knees, oh
And I'm not tryna talk
And I'm not tryna walk
Just lift me out the club
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Juicy J]
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Pounds of weed, Sour D
That medical for my allergies
In the hotel with your girl
For 'bout a week, shootin' shower scenes
She a bad chick like Bonnie Parker
Rollin' blunts in my flying saucer
Juicy J - the new Skywalker, I'll put your ho in a body auction
When I'm having fun, I'm still getting paid
Got a whole lot of mud in my Minute Maid
Stay riding through the city with my 12-gauge
Hating ass niggas, get it any day
Got a house on the hill cost a couple of mil'
Juicy J got bank like uncle Phil
Keep snow bunnies that like poppin' pills
Keep a double cup, I like crackin' seals
Y'all niggas shit, I'm still going strong
Bought the loud pack now I'm in my zone
Rolls Royce got me feeling like King Tut
Got my codeine cups, 'bout to drink up
If you're talkin' 'bout money, we can link up
Bad red boned bitch, body inked up!
Your girlfriend comin' home with me
And when she alone with me
She gonna suck dick and she don't spit
Or I'ma put that bitch back on the streets
I'm kickin' it with girls that be going bi
Cause their pussy is the best and they head fire
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Juicy J]
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Hey, I'ma visit the sky today
Hey, I'ma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Juicy J]
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'102Embed

Short hair, like Nia Long, loose ones, she don't need a loan
Start twerkin' when she hear her song, stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some, so nasty when she rollin'
She put that ass up in my hands, I remote control it (Yeah, ho)
She give me dome when the roof gone
After K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends, bring three. I got drugs, I got drink (Yeah, ho)
Bend it over, Juicy J gon' poke it like wet paint (Yeah, ho)
You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J can't (Yeah, ho)
Racks everywhere, they showin' racks, I'm throwin' racks
In the V.I.P, rubber on I'm stretchin' that
Rich niggas tippin', broke niggas lookin'
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showin' pussy

[Chorus: Juicy J & Lil Wayne]
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance

Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga
Smokin' on Keysh, Cole, gimme me chills nigga
What's your real name? And not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bands a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit it from the side like a mothafuckin' bass drum
Two hoes on one fuckin' pole, two hoes on my fuckin' pole
I don't tip, I pay bills, bitches call me Buffalo
Her stomach in and her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waitin' for my bitch to cash out (Haha)

[Chorus: Juicy J & Lil Wayne]
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bands

If yo girl don't swallow kids, man, that ho basic
Got two bitches with me, take a shot of one ho, usin' her friend for a chaser
Bands a make her bust it, let me see you touch it
Money talk, you ain't got none, end of discussion
Bands a make her do it, pocket full of money
Young nigga gettin' head while the engine runnin'
Let me see you wiggle, do it for a real nigga
I be laughin' to the bank, all you do is giggle
Ballin' in my coupe, call it sports car
Drop the top and freak it, treat that bitch just like a porn star

[Chorus: Juicy J]

Twenty stacks in one night, I be on trippy shit
My cribs paid off, but I’m still paying rent
A couple of condos paid, she lovin’ every cent
She make that ass clap, dancin' like she on a dick
Bring it back I threw a stack, that's one lucky bitch
Up and down she’s going she’s sliding on that pole
Making money, stacking them honey, shawty go

Yeah, yeah, we gon' stay trippy for life, mane

Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it

Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I love the way she slow dance, she make me throw more bands
Grabbin' ass with both hands, she in love with the dope man
She wanna be my main chick, I was thinkin' different
Clap that ass, light our blunt, baby, let’s get ig'nant
She strips for the Gs, rake cash like leaves
She got double Ds, and ain’t shit free
Came with my goons but I’m leavin' with a diva
With an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms
She ain’t finished college, she a head doctor
Bouncin ass while I’m gettin' high as propellers on a helicopter
Let’s do it again, me, you and your friend
We don’t even need a room, give me head up in my Benz
Where my double cup? Time to pour it up
Got a bitch so bad you can’t afford to fuck, bounce it

[Hook: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it

(Wale though, le'go)
Hands is on her you know what
'Cause bands a make her you know what
And I can make a girl break fast
My pants be on that too much lunch
And I’m ’bout whatever baby, take a photo, I’m lookin' good
And these breezies are so beneath you, understand you’re misunderstood
Premium leather goods, we pay whatever for it
Over these pussy niggas, only under influence
Throw a block up then I back out, like that
Roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I’ma smack
And a bucket but we nothin' but tatted
Bald-headed scallywags, real niggas salute me
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy
Or Marc Gasol, or Selby do, that’s plenty dough
That’s Juicy J, Folarin, got it then get me those, Ralph

Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand, thousand

Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Turn up, Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy
Toss up that cash and she show me her kitty
Got some white girl and a white girl
Do a Montana line off of her titty
Ain’t tryna fuck, I just found a replacement
Feelin' so global, I think I need Asian
Ratchet on deck and they know I’m gon’ stunt
I’m tryna get head while smokin' a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up
I don’t know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie
Then codeine in a Styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin'
Do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can’t fit in my pocket
Keep that stack, hundred K in the stockin'
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest
I don’t buy these broads Nike, but I keep these girls in check
Workin' for that money, bitch, you gon’ have to break a sweat, bounce it

[Hook: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it

Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it

Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it

Pockets so swole I think they finna bust
Ace in my hand and a 45 tuck
Money coming down codeine pourin' up
Smokin on some dope, always on a float

Money adding up you haters going broke
Still in the game while you niggas ridin' oak

For Everybody Lyrics[Intro: Juicy J]
It's a lot been going on mane
Know what I'm sayin'?
Time for me to address this shit
Tired of hearing about it
Let's go, yeah

[Hook: Juicy J & (Rock City)]
(These hoes) They for everybody
Pass them all around, they at every party
They ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody
Still I love these hoes
(These hoes) They for everybody
Oh, that was your girl? Oops, I'm sorry
Don't bring her around, this just too much money
Yeah I love these hoes
[Verse 1: Juicy J]
She's a super freak, super freak
Met her in Liv last week
She was in there with Meek
In VIP, then she left with me
She said she fuck with Breezy
Do I wanna keep it? Nah, that ho too sleazy
Now she fuck with Jeezy
Don't believe me? The shit's all over TV
Now she work the pole, but you ain't know
That's how she make her dough
Seen her in New York
She was all throwed, forgot we met before
She say she fuck with Drake
I ain't surprised, all these hoes fucking with Drake
I asked why she out this way
Said she on a date, then she left with Trey
When will niggas learn?
Hoes like a doorknob, everybody gets a turn
Chicks be so high-class on the internet
But don't got shit she earned
She got that bag from Juicy J
She got that ass from Rudy Gay
Now your silly ass down on one knee
Fuck man, is you cray?
[Hook: Juicy J & (Rock City)]
These hoes
They for everybody
Pass them all around, they at every party
They ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody
Still I love these hoes
These hoes They for everybody
Oh, that was your girl? Oops, I'm sorry
Don't bring her around, this just too much money
Yeah I love these hoes

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Man, I fell in love with a stripper
Funny thing is I fell back out of love quicker
They don't pay attention to love anyway
They only concerned with what the haters say
Bottles be turnin these girls into thots
Instagram turnin these wifes into hoes
No real life they just readin the comments
Mess with a real one and get you exposed
I had a time when my mind was caught up
My niggas was lookin like what is he on
My family was too scared to talk to a nigga
Ain't comin back now the case just got closed
She do what she told
Sharin' is carin' that pussy ain't gold
Sorry you ain't in control
You all about that money, thats shit that I throw
Just make sure you clean off that pole
They turn on the TV and get on the gram
And say that's relationship goals
Trust me don't save em' anything goes with...
[Hook: Juicy J & (Rock City)]
These hoes
They for everybody
Pass them all around, they at every party
They ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody
Still I love these hoes
These hoes They for everybody
Oh, that was your girl? Oops, I'm sorry
Don't bring her around, this just too much money
Yeah I love these hoes
[Bridge: Juicy J]
Stop cuffing my nigga, is you the police?

Why you cuffin' my nigga? Is you the police?

[Verse 2: K. Camp]
Look, all she need is one more shot, that bitch lit, you can tell
Put this package, in yo box, you got mail
Smoke one more, touch that cloud, this that loud
That lil bitch, she get active, she get wild
We turnt up, too much liquor you can't hold me
Liked her pic, fucked her friend, now she know me
Drop my top, out that roof, that's that Rollie
Girl don't play, I'm right here, you gon' show me
[Chorus: K. Camp]
All I need is one more drank
Two more blunts, three more bitches
Four more zips, five more minutes
All I need is one more drank, one more drank

Two more blunts, three more bitches
Four more zips, five more minutes
All I need is one more drank, one more drank
All I need is one more drank, one more drank

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Damn I miss the '90s, yeah shit was wild
We was livin' like rock stars, droppin' Mystic Styles
Ain't nobody else believe in what we was puttin' down
Nigga almost homeless trying to get it off the ground
No support everybody thought we never be shit
Tryna start our own label on some Master P shit
Tryna get some distribution majors labels ain't feelin' us
Doors slammed in our face, still ain't givin' up
Still on the grind, still on the rise
Even had to sell my whip to pay for studio time
Made a name, made some change, got respect, got some fame
Now they love our shit, cuz we made our own lane
Tryna sign everybody, put some money in their pockets
Had a ball on the rug, every night we had it poppin'
They ain't hold us down, did it on our own
With our backs on da wall, we put plaques on the wall
Then the problems started picking up, posse start splitting up
People started switching up, we still not giving up
I love them though, we been through it all
They're my brothers though, now that's some real shit
We weren't always rich, we didn't have a pot to piss
Hustle harder than a bitch, slanging records like they bricks
From the ground to the throne, its been a hell of a trip
Bring me one more drank, while I sit and reminisce52Embed

Fuck your boyfriend, I don't want your number
Let me get that becky while I'm rollin' up
Send my watch back to my jeweler, it ain't cold enough
Just a bunch of bad college chicks in the W with no clothes on
Trippy cup in my hand in the bathtub with my robe on
Tell all your girlfriends that I'm breakin' bread and down to fuck
One night, fuck a wife, trippy niggas never cuff

So she only fucking rappers, she tired of Kappas
And she only shake for backups, so shake it faster
It gets better every chapter, spit that Project Patta

Money, money, money while she grindin' on the pole
Dollar for a show but don't nobody gotta know
(Get it, get it off the floor)
She shakin' it like she strippin'
She only representin' for her bitches out in Memphis
Hol' up, hol' up wait a minute, I just came to my senses
I'm trippin' if I'm trickin' if I'm paying your tuition
Cause you know a couple principles or pals in your division
Pay attention, how I'm livin', bet you hate it like detention
Motherfucker...

Baby I'm so excited, how about we do it in private
Come get hooked on the juice, I'm so doge you should try it
Let me pay for your class, let me cover your books
Honey this stack in my pocket is probably thinking its a book
This a millionaire dollar team, you should come and join
You can get a pimp house at the trunk fuck a don
You know top notch Gs get the most, not the lesser
Come and fuck with Juicy J, get more than your professor

Low Lyrics[Intro: Juicy J & Young Thug]
My beat low, my bass low, I ride low, she go low
My beat low, my bass low, I ride low
Juicy, tell 'em what you said bruh

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Me, Juicy J, got too many hoes
Me, Juicy J, got too many flows
Clique ballin' out, like the '98 Lakers
Pull up in a million dollar car and violate it
Fly to Cancun on Sunday, land in France on Monday
Faded at the fashion show, tryna grab a bitch off the runway
I ain't even pack no clothes, nothin' but rubbers in my suitcase
Laid her on the mic, menage with my model and her roommate
And if I tip a bitch, we fuckin', it ain't no discussion
It cost to be the boss, my nigga, you way out of your budget
Who you playin' with lil homie? Your life won't cost me nothin'
Juicy J so presidential, don't make me press that button
[Pre-Chorus: Juicy J]
My beat low, my bass low, I ride low, she go low
My beat low, my bass low, I ride low, she go low

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I get a brick, you know I get it for the low
Her ass so fat, I told her drop it down low
I do a verse, you know my prices ain't low
Lil momma know I like my kisses down low

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Me, Nicki M, I got too many wins
Pull up with them V twins in my engine
All this ice all around me, like a penguin
I ain't talkin' bowlin', but I'm with the kingpin
I pull up with a nigga with a real big dick, that's just so good, man a bitch came quick
I ain't ever have a beat, that a bitch ain't rip
I'm fly everyday, but a bitch ain't trippin'
You be on that bull, you be on Scott Pippen
I be pimp walkin', I'm limpin'
C's on my bag, so they think I'm crippin'
Every nigga in here wanna know what I'm drinkin'
Myx Moscato, niggas
I keep a pillow with me, just because I'm tired of niggas
I'm with some flawless girls, they're pretty and they're thick
Bust it open quick, put that pussy on his lips, bitch
[Pre-Chorus: Juicy J]
My beat low, my bass low, I ride low, she go low
My beat low, my bass low, I ride low, she go low

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I get a brick, you know I get it for the low
Her ass so fat, I told her drop it down low
I do a verse, you know my prices ain't low
Lil momma know I like my kisses down low

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
I'm Lil Bibby, Mr. Everything-For-The-Low
Mr. Leave-Her-At-Home-He'll-Take-Your-Ho
Mr. Stack-That-Dough
Young rich nigga used to trap by the store, now I tax for the flow
Tell a rap nigga, "I'm not feelin' you"
Stop frontin', boy, y'all not criminals
At the top, man they talkin' 'bout killin' you
Got two 9's but they're not identical
I'll never trade on my squad, nigga
Ball hard, nigga, I'm Michael Jordan, you Lebron, nigga
In other words, you a fraud, nigga
I'll pull your card, nigga
I'm a young boss, I'm runnin' shit
Call me King Tut, all this gold on, I be blinged up
If they try to rob, got the things tucked, you ain't seen nothin'
At the club, their jaws drop when I pull up in that Benz
Thirty deep, 'bout twenty heats, still stomp him out with my Timbs
I'm in here chillin' with my feet up
I told y'all that I'm 'bout to heat up
Man it's time to kill all this weak stuff
Pull the beat up, watch me eat up
[Pre-Chorus: Juicy J]
My beat low, my bass low, I ride low, she go low
My beat low, my bass low, I ride low, she go low

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I get a brick, you know I get it for the low
Her ass so fat, I told her drop it down low
I do a verse, you know my prices ain't low

On the lean poppin' Rose with a kush blunt
With a bitch, ass fat, see it from the front
Mind gone, man I'm trippy and my eyes low
Everything purple, all I see is weed smoke
Codeined out, but my bitch gon' try
If you say I ain't high, then you niggas lyin'
A bunch of Taylor's, Memphis niggas gettin' throwed nigga
A bunch of hoes in this crib, bunch of O's nigga
Off that oil and it's dirty and I'm feeling great
Smoke a blunt or two or three just to keep me straight
You getting high, what ho, make a decision
That medical promethazine trippy prescription
Cups overflowin', my vision is dizzy (my vision is dizzy)
I'm like Bobby Brown ho without New Edition

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Purple, purple, purple, cup always full
Pass it in a circle, everybody smoking good
On the daily might, smoke an ounce just to fuck around
Weed man sold out when I'm in your town
2050 Trippy, she got a sippy cup
They say don't drink and sip that lean but I mix em up
Turnt up to the max, real ratchet shit
She bad and she smoked probably half that bitch
You niggas still gettin' tipsy, catch me leanin'
Smoke some incredible, feel like I'm dreamin'
My crib in Cali like Texas sippin' DJ Screw (Rest in peace)
Fridge full of Bombay but you can't find no juice

In the drought, come fuck for free, for real
But for me it's still on the house
I get it cheap for real without a re, you tell (run your mouth)
Hop in my vehicle, I put the d in tail
Burning out, I push the V6-12, I put the V in 12
200 miles, cuz' if I see the twelve
My speed won't leave a trail
Don't turn around
Cuz if I, if I, if I see the jail
Then I won't see you girl
If I, if I, if I meet your friend
Then I won't need you girl
If you, if you, if you give me threesome shit
Then I won't leave you girl
You gotta go, if you shy to ride a stripper pole
There it go, real niggas know
Real girls get down on the floor, on the floor

Aye, Ruby da—, Ruby da—, Ruby da—, aye

[Verse 3: RUBY DA CHERRY]
I once knew this hoe named Margaret
Who thought that she was hard to get
Then when she wanted somethin', yeah, I bought her it
Ruby beat the pussy with a bat!—yeah, he slaughter it
Cuttin' up like back in fucking class, but I'm smarter, bitch
Curve a fucking hoe 'cause she a duck, and no, I want no part of it
It's still "fuck a hoe", she think my dick some sort of parlor trick
It's still run a whore over with the foreign drip
Ask her how the tires fuckin' taste, yeah, that's the start, lil' bitch
Ruby got the big body Benz, ain't no parking it
She want them kids inside her pussy, but there ain't no parkin' it, uh

[Verse 4: $CRIM]
Slob on my knob, lil' bitch, do your job
Suck it with the skin, while you fuck the whole team
Rob you out your pockets, whistle up the code
All my partners dipped in gold, hit my little bottom, bitch
Lesbo in the closet, still bouncin' like hydraulics
Six-fo' knockin', all these hoes like Death Row '94
Black, Asian, Persian, even white girls
Skinny savage pimp with a mink coat, walkin' with a limp
Cut Throat, Rocky, Plague, and Uncle Juicemane
Still fuck a hoe
And that's goin' to the grave, that's goin' to the grave12Embed

Head so good, gotta keep in touch
Throw that wood, 'til I drive the bitch nuts, I put it in her guts
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw, I outline that pussy in chalk
Hold my dick, a deadly weapon, damn right I break the law
Right before she threw it back, I threw dick up in her jaw
She can have a nigga hooked, but I'ma fuck and cut her off
I know your bitch want that gangsta dick
She take the shit, my paper thick

This that higher level stunting, make it rain a lot of hundreds
Gave that chick 30k to go get rid of her stomach
I'm a triple OG nigga 20 years and running
All my niggas down to ride like crash test dummies
And J don't stand in line, I ain't never had to wait
I'm the realest in this game, I ain't never had to fake
Forgiatos on the classic like that bitch got on some skates
Having dinner with Obama smelling like a pound of hay
I might blow a pound a day, smoking KK like a hippie
In the 60's with this chick, tryna give my dick a hickey
Had to get it out the mud, no wonder why I'm filthy rich
And I'm running through this money
Like it don't mean nothing to me, I might
[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing

Buy a new crib like it ain't nothing

Pull up in the lowrider two hoes behind us
Police say that they can smell it but I make sure they don't find it
Hit the corner, slide the ash, Young Khalifa bout his cash
'Bout to build another whip and I ain't even got to brag
Three women got that bitch leanin'
Young Khalifa got the women screamin'
Done deal, done deal
When I pull up, it's a done deal
Lift the trunk, still rolling up
And I got one in the front, two in the back
Do what I want, don't need to relax
King of my city, I'm living to show 'em
I cannot be even, three wheelin' in traffic
This '61 I'm building 'bout to be a classic
I'm repping Taylor Gang – they asking; paper or plastic?

Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing (Oh shit)

Know Betta Lyrics[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Niggas talking like they stunting
But real niggas ain't stupid
Who you think you fooling
You gon have to come prove it
You know me I'm a OG
I don't say it unless I do it
Got a pistol off in my 550 nigga don't make me use it
You rap niggas is clueless
Getting money is my duty
And if the truth is really naked then Juicy Js a nudist
Your girlfriends my groupie if I speak to her she gonna lose it
Fuck nigga you mad? I don't give a fuck, sue me
A hundred deep we all strapped
Pistols all on our waistline
Real niggas don't talk about it we shoot it out in the daytime
In the streets you really not
Extended clip I won't miss a shot
Try me I'll put you in a pine box
My trigger finger got the chicken pox
I got money I got hoes getting head in my drop top rolls
All this chicken and all this syrup you think we at Roscoes
I'm smoking and I'm driving while I'm rolling up
You broke so I smoke enough for both of us

Million dollars that's independent
Look at us say those niggas getting it
Niggas don't play with me
They know I got a couple niggas that'll spray for me
They know that if it come down to it that I'll pay the cost
Before you say your ready for war be prepared to take a loss, Bitch I'm a boss
I be rolling up that good, nigga

Might be my goons that's on the crime scene
Throwing their gang up when they approach
Don't even talk bank cause you know its bigger
Ain't in first class cause I'm the only nigga

Stop It Lyrics[Intro]
I'ma tell you broke niggas something
Listen

[Verse 1]
Make money, no vacation
Pay cash, don't make payments
Getting high like I'm eighteen
But I've been rich since the late eighties
Backstage, naked ladies
Popping pills and swallowing babies
Bad bitches ain't come to play
She gon' give me head before I go on stage
New car, a couple, a hundred, ain't nothin' I call it play money
Bugatti, Ferrari, the Benz, the Bentley, Juicy stay stuntin'
Street niggas, we packing them tools
Play with it, make action news
Put some money on your head, you worth a stack or two
Real nigga I'm 100, I sip lean and I chase money
Niggas out here saving hoes, niggas need to be saving money
Made mine, can't take it from me
Hit the club, I take your woman
Take her home, get some head
Wake up breakfast in bed
Yeah nigga that's grits and eggs
Rich bitch don't forget the bread
Up and down that interstate
I move weight, that's Jenny Craig
I'ma fuck me a model, I'ma fuck me a model
You only get to live one time, so I'ma fuck me a model
[Hook]
I make money all day then I ball with the profits
Niggas hating on me, I tell em hating niggas stop it
Go fuck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone
Catch me on that loud pack, blowing on this strong

I make money all day then I ball with the profits
Niggas hating on me, I tell em hating niggas stop it
Go fuck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone
Catch me on that loud pack, blowing on this strong

[Interlude]
Straight out of north Memphis nigga
20 years in
Still rich and ain’t gon stop getting rich
Told you niggas I ain’t gon' never gonna stop getting money
Let’s get it

[Verse 2]
Bitch you ain’t no killer and real niggas don’t talk
Start shit in this club, It’s going down in the parking lot
Niggas get killed everyday, we ain't shedding no tears
Niggas can’t keep they mouth closed, judge give you them years
Yo homie fucking yo bitch and she ain't sucking your cock
Them niggas ain't holding you down and you call them niggas yo dogs
They really out here hating, so stay strapped up like a tank
They got guns they got in movies except they not shootin' blanks
Pass straight in broad daylight, they don’t care who looking
Young niggas got something to prove, nigga think he pussy
Playing round in my hood and they'll smoke you like a Swisher
We don’t play 'bout money and we don’t play with them pistols
[Hook]
I make money all day then I ball with the profits
Niggas hating on me, I tell em hating niggas stop it
Go fuck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone
Catch me on that loud pack, blowing on this strong

I make money all day then I ball with the profits
Niggas hating on me, I tell em hating niggas stop it
Go fuck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone
Catch me on that loud pack, blowing on this strong10Embed

If you believe in having sex, say "hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
If you believe in having sex, say "hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
If you believe in having sex, say "hell, fuck yeah" (Yes sir)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Shawty throw me that ass, hold up let me see it
Pop it let me touch it, bring it back and let me squeeze it
Go on show me that pussy cat, I'mma take it home and feed it
If it's good as it looks, might go in raw and seed it
Pop a couple of these bands, she poppin' open that G-string
Pussy wet as a pool, and Juicy J's in the deep end
Bands a make her dance, I don't tip till I see pussy
And she ain't got no waist line, that ass as soft as a seat cushion
Damn right I make it rain, all night that's a hurricane
Strip club run out of ones, I'm throwin' twenties I dont need change
Every time she drop it, I'm goin' off to my pocket
Fifty thousand in the air, I ain't worried I got it

Uh yea, fat bitch, don't see no bra, savage
I don't even fuck around 'bout the cabbage
Them hoes just sweet, average
J know the mango Juicy, he love my big ol' booty
Louboutins bake my cookie, Bugatti bitch no hooptie
If I let you feature my movie, my legs wrapped around my neck
If I let you feature in my movie, somebody cuttin' me a big check
Hoodrich, he got a donkey dick
I'm Aquafina make 'em dive in it
I wanna feel his third leg while he's strokin' it
Throw my face in the pillow while he crankin' it
Oh yeah, bend me over, take a pic
Stroke me good, throw me deep dick
Lets put this shit on Instagram, it's Juicy J and Trina bitch

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Yeah
2 Chainz!
I don’t give a fi-nuck, put it in her gin-uts
Hit a strip club, ran out of ones so now I got to re-up
I don’t give a fi-nuck, put in her gin-uts
I don’t give a, I don’t give a, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t
I don’t give a fi-nuck, put in her gin-uts
Hit a strip club, ran out of ones so now I got to re-up
Sex pistol, lady killer
B-b-b-bust a nut on her, and that's baby sittin', (Damn)
Ok, now next contestant, I smoked a blunt for breakfast
Skeeted on her chest, and thats a fuckin' necklace
By the time you get back, I'll be somewhere leaving strokers
With a girl like Pocahontas, with her hair down to her shoulders
Unconditional love, we can do it in a Porsche
From the Porsche to the wall, wall to the sofa
I'm supposed to post her, it's La Cosa Nostra
Then I pull her closer, hit her with the poker
[Outro: Uncle Luke]
If you believe in having sex, say "hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
If you believe in having sex, say "hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
If you believe in having sex, say "hell yeah" (Hell yeah)

All I Blow Is Loud Lyrics[Intro]
That's trippy shit right here bruh

[Hook]
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up

[Verse 1]
Smokin' gas in a rental
She givin' me mental
Countin faces (countin faces)
While she poppin molly like mentos
I got money forreal though
Split blunts down the middle
I got love for everybody, who give a fuck how you feel though
In a big house with 10 hoes
Catch me in the hills blowin endo
Pool party, that's indoors
So much gin, take a swim ho
Homie pass the weed, let's get super high
I smoke that shit that made R. Kelly think that he could fly
Droppin racks off one plate
Took her to the strip then blew it
Took a lot of gin and some pills, took her to my hotel room like screw it
Smokin on pounds, smokin on pounds
In Seattle where ain't no crime
All I do is smoke weed and rhyme
Sip codeine just to ease my mind
[Hook]
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up

[Verse 2]
Chugging on lean and I’m chiefin' on skunk
With your main girl, eat my dick like it's lunch
Kick it so tough, you would think I’m gon punt
Nigga so high, you would think I’m gon' jump
Upwards and downwards just like a seesaw
Her titties keep bouncing just like a beach ball
She’s on one, I’m on two, we smoking, we fucking
On so many drugs that we can’t sleep it off
Goons on my side, I got cars I don’t drive
Got a bitch in my bed that’s somebody’s bride
Got kush in my blunt, got lean in my sprite
I’m drunk as a fish and I’m high as a kite
Two dime bitches and I’m in the middle
Maybach come with curtains, I ain’t got tinted windows
Eyes stay low, I look oriental
That’s the killer loud pack in my cigarillo
No Reggie in my presence, tell them niggas get it right
I got girls doing girls, now that’s the shit I like
Now that’s the shit I love, give me pussy, money, drugs
I take thirty out my stash and go blow it with my blood
[Hook]
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up10Embed
