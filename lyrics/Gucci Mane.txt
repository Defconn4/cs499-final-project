I Get the Bag Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane & Quavo]
Ha
It's Gucci, it's Drop Top
Wizop, whoo
Yeah, ayy (Go)

[Chorus: Quavo]
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it (Yeah)
Straight out the lot, three hundred cash (Cash)
And the car came with a blunt in it (Yeah)
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass (Thot)
And she gon' fuck up a bag (Yeah)
Pull up to the spot, livin' too fast (Yeah)
Droppin' the dope in the stash (Yeah)
In Italy, got two foreign hoes, they DM me (Ooh, brr, ayy)
Drop the top when it's cold (Drop-top)
But you feel the heat (Skrrt, yeah, ayy)
Be real with me
Keep it 100, just be real with me (Ayy)
Eat it up like it's a feast (Woah, eat it up)
They say the dope on fleek (Yep)
[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Percocet pill on me (Percocet)
Ice on my neck, baby, chill with me (Ice)
Them niggas that post in the back don't say nothin'
Them niggas will kill for me
Back ends I count in my sleep, on fleek
Hundred K spent on a Patek Phillippe (Phillippe)
Bitch, I'm a dog, eat my treat (Hrr)
Hop out the frog and leap (Leap)
I put them bricks in the fender
My bitch, she walk around like she Kris Jenner (Kris Jenner)
I used to break in and enter
Then Takeoff runnin' like the game of temple (Whew)
It's simple, I play with her mental
Mama said she saw me on Jimmy Kimmel (Mama)
Count it up, 'cause I'm a money symbol
Walkin' with the racks, I'm lookin' crippled (Money)
Fuck on that bitch then I tip her (Tip her)
A nickel for me to take pictures (Nickel)
Not from L.A. but I clip her (Brr)
Double my cup, pour a triple (Actavis)
Fox on my body, no Vivica (Fox on my…)
I'm not your average or typical (I'm not your…)
Look at my wrist, and it's critical (Look at the…)
Hold it up, droppin' the temperature (Droppin' the…)
I get that bag on the regular (Bag)
I got a bag on my cellular (Brr)
Backin' up, baggin' up vegetables (Bag)
Bag of them cookies, it's medical (Cookies)
Cocaine, codeine, etcetera (White)
Cocaine and lean, it's federal (White)
I take off, landin' on Nebula
As of now twenty M's on my schedule (Takeoff)
[Chorus: Quavo & Gucci Mane]
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it (Yeah)
Straight out the lot, three hundred cash (Cash)
And the car came with a blunt in it (Yeah)
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass (Thot)
And she gon' fuck up a bag (Yeah)
Pull up to the spot, livin' too fast (Yeah)
Droppin' the dope in the stash (Yeah)

Eat it up like it's a feast (Hah, woah, eat it up)
They say the dope on fleek (Yep)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I know that these niggas gettin' sick of me (Eww-ah)
These chains on my neck cost a mil' a piece (Um)
I don't even like to freestyle for free
I put in the key and I ride the beat
I won't even come out the house for free
I pay a nigga to drive for me (Huh?)
JAY-Z couldn't even co-sign for me
I do what I want 'cause I'm signed to me (Damn)
I get the, I get the, I get the bag
They get the bag, have to cut it in half (Wop)
Stop the comparin', y'all makin' me laugh
Need the rehab, I'm addicted to cash
Convertible Wop, convertible top
My dope got a vertical, look at it hop
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, and it jump out the pot (Pot)
Came out of jail and went straight to the top
Take it easy, baby, middle of summer, I'm freezin', baby (Burr)
Don't leave me, baby
Just drop to your knees and please me, baby (Go)
I'm fascinated, two bitches so fine that I masturbated (Ha)
Congratulations, she brain me so good that I graduated (Wow)
They had to hate it
I don't fuck with them niggas, they plastic, baby (Heh)
A trapper, baby, I rap but I own all my masters, baby
It's tragic, baby, I pull up and fuck up the traffic, baby (Ha)
A savage, baby
I'm killin' these niggas, closed casket, baby (Wop)
[Chorus: Quavo]
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it (Yeah)
Straight out the lot, 300 cash (Cash)

Both Lyrics[Intro: Southside & Future]
Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me
[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

Curve Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane & The Weeknd]
Huh, it's Gucci
XO (Yeah), 1-0 (Yeah), 1-7 (Yeah)
Brr, brr
(Go)

[Verse 1: The Weeknd & Gucci Mane]
The kid back on the whiskey
Virginia Black got me tipsy
I'm in L.A. like I'm Nipsey
Spanish girls wanna kiss me
A nigga wanna come and diss me
And put a hex like a gypsy
They kill themselves, no wrist bleed
Got suicides on my SV
She do it all for the Fendi
She do it all for the Gucci (Gucci!)
Baby girl wanna choose me
She wanna use and abuse me (Uh)
I know she wanna text me (Wow)
I know she wanna sex me
Fifty thou' make her neck freeze
Fuck her once like, "Next, please"
My nigga, who would've thought? (Huh?)
My nigga, who would've thought now?
I'll be right back at the top now
I'll be right back at the top now
I got your girl on my finger
Blowin' my phone like she's single
Blowin' my phone like I'm Cee-Lo (Damn)
Somebody needs to come get her
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Gucci Mane]
Like, "Woo," with the curve (With the curve)
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it
I got that work
I know you want the Birkin, baby, are you worth it?
With the curve (With the curve)
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it
I got that work (With the, with the, with the)
I need to know for certain (It's Gucci!)
Tell me, are you worth it?

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Say I, a star was born last night
Way you showed out on that dick, girl, you performed last night
That's why you deserve that first-class flight
Buh-bye, 'cause I just quenched your thirst last night
I'm in Dubai
Somebody tell the prince that the kingpin has arrived
If I lived over here, I'd probably have one hundred wives (Damn!)
Walkin' in the club and they like, "Gucci just arrived" (Gucci!)
I ordered up a dub and then I threw it in the sky
I told her I'm a'ight, now she look like she surprised (I'm a'ight)
She look like a model, but a devil in disguise
Bum, bum-bum-bum, I feel like Rocky in his prime (Bum, bum-bum-bum, bum)
You know you came to fuck, so why the fuck we wastin' time?
I got the kind of wood that make a woman lose her mind
I'm young, rich and handsome, baby, I'm one of a kind
Just keep it real with me, baby, it won't cost you a dime
I know you got expensive taste and I don't even mind
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Gucci Mane]
Like, "Woo," with the curve (With the curve)
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it (No)
I got that work (Got that, got that, got that)
I know you want the Birkin, baby, are you worth it?
With the curve (With the curve, it's Gucci!)
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it (Hell no)
I got that work (With the, with the, with the, with the)
I need to know for certain, tell me, are you worth it?

Nothin On Ya Lyrics[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on you
I swear them hoes ain’t got nothing on you
That nigga broke, he ain’t got nothing for you
I swear these hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I fuck with you cause you’re very loyal
And you’re so fine, you make my blood boil
I have to go and get another lawyer
She took the charge, they ain’t got nothing on her
I swear to God they ain’t got nothing on her
Huh, we in the airport, she got something on her
We ball out in the mall in California
We might just pull up in twin Californias

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
Hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I think that shit just paranoia
She think I’m with another woman
Another woman that gonn keep me comin'
Girl, these hoes, they ain’t got nothing on you
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
It’s nothing, claim they aren't, but they bluffin'
Come home and I hit it hard, and she gives me head that’s concussion
I’m stunting, OG Kush what I’m puffin'
In the club you know me, I spend it all
My homies gon' get to bustin
Got a quarter million to spend
Just came home from tour and I crushed it
Just bought my wife a pair of glass shoes
Cause her ass thick as a pumpkin
They ain’t got nothing on her
She don’t want no other nigga, she fuckin with a stoner
And if I’m up in this bitch, then I’m prolly with the owner
Hella bottles, hella marijuana, anything you want, my niggas got it
We got liquor, we got mollies, we got bitches tryna ride, taking pictures
We just standing on the couches, they could try but

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on her
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
Hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I think that shit just paranoia
She think I’m with another woman
Another woman that gonn keep me comin'
Girl, these hoes, they ain’t got nothing on you
[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I fuck with shawty cause she very loyal
We can tie the knot like Memph and Toya
I won’t ignore you and I won’t divorce you
Let's have two girls and call them Rolls and Porsche
I respect that girl, I accept that girl
I’ll do anything I can to protect that girl
If I could do it all again, would have kept that girl
But I’m unhealthy for you baby I fuck up your world
You your Daddy's lil girl, but you’s a grown lady
And I don’t see you like he see you cause we not related
We got faded at my spot, I swear we're so wasted
After the third shot of patron, I swear can’t even taste it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
Hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I think that shit just paranoia
She think I’m with another woman
Another woman that gonn keep me comin
Girl, these hoes, they ain’t got nothing on you15Embed

Trappin' off a pack, know I trap house trap
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
You know I got me an agenda
Break that thing up in my blender
Got a warrant, no surrender
Sub-machine with that extender
I came up on a pissy mattress
I got more money then all these rappers
Tried to hit me up in traffic
But I had to work my magic
I'm riding 'round with my lieutenant
I let 'em count it and I spend it
Bitches come after my business
Catching bodies in these trenches (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me

St. Brick Intro Lyrics[Intro]
An igloo full of snow and a white stove
House full of naked hoes snortin' blow
It's so lonely at the top, plus its real cold
A house full of hoes and they cookin' blow
I'm in Zone Six aka the North Pole
Burr! EA, GA
1-0-1-7, Wop, six

[Verse]
Middle of the winter I pull up in a vert
It's the middle of December she pulled up in a skirt
Santa Claus of the hood
I pull up with the work
They call me East Atlanta Santa
Run up on me get murked
I'm just trappin' through the snow
Sellin' nine half a bricks in four ways
Over the hills we go
Got an extendo and an AK (gra, gra, gra)
I'm a neighborhood philanthropist
I'm sellin' bales of cannabis
Preachin' like an evangelist
But I don't fuck with amateurs
I drive spiders, yeah, tarantulas
My diamonds are immaculate
I'm not on no romantic shit
But I'm cookin' cocaine, candle lit
I'm so trill, your ho can't handle it
But damn, that bitch can suck a dick
Skeeted on her face and lip
Guwop can't fuck no basic bitch
The teacher teachin' arithmetic
Show you how to whip a brick
Learn you how you run your clique
And told you how to kill a snitch
My young girl she a freaky chick
But damn she on that sneaky shit
Ran off with a half a zip
And now I got to slap a trick
All these record labels broke as shit
Ricky Dinky record shit
I sell more meth than a Mexican
My dog food yea its excellent
I done started sellin' Christmas tree
I'm tryna jingle bells ho
Its Christmas time its Hollis, Queens
I'm stompin' in my shell toes
Christmas time in '96
I asked Santa for twelve golds
But now Guwop got gifts to give
But I don't fuck with twelve though
[Outro]
Santa Claus in the city, bag full of goodies
I wish these faggot-ass cops would let a nigga live
I'm tryna come down the chimney with a 100 mil
I'm the Bricksquad boss I'm like Santa Claus26Embed

Your nigga pinchin' pennies, but I'm out here making these millions, bitch
Don't ask me who I'm votin' for 'cause I got all the presidents (Racks!)
My bitch walk 'round in lingerie all day, she think she elegant (Mwah!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Me and Guwop making super moves
Making stupid cash, stack it through the roof
You don't fuck with me? The feeling mutual
I'd feel the same if I drove that Subaru
We hit the city, the old me going OC
How her friend only gonna watch that, that is so weak
Seven times in a row, I could go the whole week
I could take you from the nosebleeds to the floor seats
But I need that, in the sauna, in the bathroom, at your mama's
Like a porn star, I'm a monster; you a dancer, on the camera
In the G-string, girl, I want you; at the concert, at the condo
In my bedroom, in the guest room
In the restroom, fuck it, every room (Yeah!)
Tryna see that...
[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pussy print (Huh?), p-pussy print

The last time I drunk some lean, I was out of my mind (Lean)

A married woman divorced her husband to spend the weekend with me
He think it nasty when she squirt, but that shit sexy to me (Hah)
The last time I took some molly, took a gram and a half (Ooh)
Niggas think they know 'bout Gucci but they don't know the half
See, I'm an ex-X popper and online shopper (Ooh)
Niggas thought I was a clone, they heard me speak proper (Proper)
Convicted felon worth 10 million, I'm a well-known robber (Wow)
Like Shawty Lo, I got 10 children
Yeah, yeah, Lo my partner, Wop (Lo)
[Chorus: Travis Scott & Gucci Mane]
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Hah)

Makin' money all year, talkin' fifty-two weeks strong
Better back up, give me space (Yeah)

Goin' Pharrell Williams on the case (Oh my god)
Oh, then we skate-skate-skate away (Yeah)

Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Hah)
[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]

Last time I went to Vegas, spent 200k gamblin' (Wow)

And that don't mean shit cause the bitch still lied

Ain't even got a dime, she broke
But she fine, she need help
She tired, they listenin'
She wired, she snitchin'
Be quiet, I'm runnin'

Outside, it runnin'
And I'm out I'm smashin'

But no draft pick cos she a broke bitch
Go hang yourself here the rope bitch

Can't really put no price on you, cause baby swallow
Suck my dick and lick my balls all night girl you a baller
And if I ever see the bitch in LIV she get a bottle

I Think I Love Her Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, hey
Gucci always talkin' 'bout he love somebody
He don't love nobody (Uh-uh)
Matter fact, nigga, you owe me some money don't you?
Let me show you how I do this shit (Get money)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit, with my spoiled lil' chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist, match this yellow bitch
She a trip, shawty, she the shit, she know she the shit
If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit
She a bitch, shawty, mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid, give her candy stick
She a pit, make her flip a brick, make her sick a chick
Since a jit, I've been slangin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit (Burr)
I met a girl name Susie, I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe
I stashed her in my fender wall and stashed her in my tire
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar
Susie roll in '08 'Rari but that girl on fire
Pull us over Candler Road, said she had some priors
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singing like Mariah
Singing like the choir, better yet singing like Mya (Bitch)
[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think I'm loyal but I fucks with all the hustlas
I be wit' all the ballas, I be at all the spots
I might be in yo' kitchen, nigga, cooking with yo' pots

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Told my boy, man, Polow Da Don
I think I love this girl, man, huh, why?
She sweet but keep kief, she stains her Irene
Two piece, she dime piece and jeans, they dead meat
She sweet, she so deep, she read with good teeth
Two jobs, she get cheese, her dates, are my treat
How neat, she loves to eat, we eat bon appétit
We feed, she's so neat and like me, she so neat
[Verse 4: Ester Dean]
Nigga, always talk but I run the block
This bitch is so hot, my clique, I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks, I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots, expose the have-nots
My hoes pose with pot like young Goldilocks
We got white bulging rocks, Ziploc stocks to cop
We never closin' shop, we hot, steaming hot
I'm Susie Sarah plot, a click clack, p-pop-pop

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me

1st Day out Tha Feds Lyrics[Intro]
EarDrummers
Yeah, it's Wizop
It's Gucci
Hah
Mike Will
Mike Will Made-It

[Verse]
I'm hearin' shooters loadin' pistols while I'm brushin' my teeth (Dang)
I get so many death threats, it's getting normal to me
But I bend, don't break, I don't ask, just take
Black gloves, black tape and I don't play nor pray (Nope)
Wake up and take a piss, I hear 'em sharpening knives
Main focus every day is make it out here alive (Lawd)
Take a shower in my boots and go to sleep in my shoes
Last night, I had a dream some killers ran in my room (Ah)
Trying to be patient, but nigga, I can't wait (Nah)
Only chance to kill my enemies and beat my case (Yeah)
So when they ask me how I feel about 'em, I can't say
You either with me or against me or you in my way (Pussy)
I got a pack of hungry wolves and if I don't feed 'em
Then they might turn on me, feel like I don't need 'em
I keep the best pedigree, but hell, I don't breed 'em (Grr)
It's a lot of people scared of me and I can't blame 'em
They call me crazy so much, I think I'm starting to believe 'em
I did some things to some people that was downright evil
Is it karma coming back to me? So much drama
My own mama turned her back on me and that's my mama (Mama)
I lost three people close to me in one summer
Ten years later, still don't know shot up my Hummer (Hmmm)
But I bend I don't break, I don't ask I take (I take)
Black gloves and black tape, nigga, it's my first day (Wop)

Drove U Crazy Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Huh, yeah, it's Gucci!
Tiller! Brr, brr-brr!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Pull up in a Lam', it'll drive you crazy
Had to cut her off cause the bitch too lazy
She wanna ride the wave, but my waves too wavy
And your car too slow, you need to drive Miss Daisy
Jumped out the feds like, "Fuck you, pay me"
Got her foamin' mouth like the bitch got rabies
Got me runnin' out the spot like the spot got raided
'Cause I'm so much different then the nigga you dated
Smilin' in the camera like, "Bitch, I made it"
Big Guwop got the whole club faded
Got a bitch so bad that my ex bitch hate it
Tell me how you feel when you see me skatin'
Nah, you don't call me baby
We ain't finna go to the mall,Ms. Lady
When you leave me feelin' standin' tall, Ms. Lady
Like can you take it, take it, take it all, Ms. Lady?
Never get a love like this
Never ever, ever meet a thug like this
Never met a plug like this
Never seen a nigga in the club like this
Never hug like this
Never pour Ace of Spades in the tub like this
Never got drunk like this
Or beat from the back on the rug like this
[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
What? Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me
Talk about them
Talk about them lies you told me
Talk about true colors you showed me

Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me

Talk about them lies you told me
Talk about true colors you showed me

Aye, lil' mama say she fuck with me tough, yeah
Lil' mama say she fuck with me tough, yeah

Aye, Young Tiller goin' up, yeah
At your head with that uppercut, yeah

But y'all already know where I'm from, yeah
Straight from the 502, hey
Southside Dirty, I grew, hey
Now they wanna show my moves, hey
Every little thing that I do and say
My old bitch said she need closure
I just think she wanna get closer
I just think she want some exposure
Tell people how crazy I drove her
Tell people all the dreams I sold her
I'm sorry, you cannot lean on my shoulder
I already got too many burdens
Most of them 'bout to give to my attorney
I got too many niggas in my face now
This ain't the time 'nor place now
This for my niggas that stay down
Fuck all you niggas that wanna hate now
[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
What? Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me

Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh?)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I've got a chick so fine, make a blind man see her (Woo)
She runnin' through my mind, that's a fine idea (Yeah)
And I ain't Blake Griffin, I don't drive no Kia (Huh?)
If it ain't ten mil', I can't sign no deal (No)
I'm all about a check, fresh Nikes, let's do it (Checks)
And I spy a bitch that wanna straight get to it (I spy)
Trap tutorial, ridin' down Memorial (Yoom)
From the bando to the Waldorf Astoria (Woah)
If you don't like to see niggas shine, then close your eyes then (Huh)
We on a private island, vibin' to violins
Autobiography, Gucci Mane the author
And I'm the trap sponsor, Gucci Mane's the father (Yeah)
An eight-figure nigga just walked into Walter's (What?)
If you ain't gettin' money, then move out of Georgia (Go)
Hundred tapes and goin', go check my discography (Woah)
The freshest nigga livin', go check your photography (It's Gucci)

Cartier frames, call me four eyes

Promoter just brought me two hundred grand
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed
[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I just drove the Tesla with both eyes closed (True)
Made a hundred thousand on the one-eyed stove (That's right)
Two-tone Wraith and a two-tone PP
Walked out of Gucci with the two-tone GG (Tell 'em)
Bulletproof Rhino, coke color albino
Yeah, my sauce A1, no Fogo de Chão
Makin' money in piles, sellin' people the pyro
Click the link in the bio, I'm the illest that I know
I'm the illest to rivals, all my cars got a title
Had to rock just like Tidal, sell a preacher the Bible
I'm a hustler for real, sell a hospital vitals
Sell my cousin some Adderall 'cause he takin' his finals
Tity Boi your highness, make it through any crisis
All I do is look straight, all the bullshit behind us
Got the 'Ye on the bracelet, got the 'Ye on the frame
Got the 'Ye on the watch, wore the 'Ye to the game

[Chorus: Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz & Young Dolph]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt, wow)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say

And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed (Hold up)
[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Don't mean to brag and boast, but I be fresher than most (Ayy)
Ran through my first million playin' on the West Coast (Trap)
Keep some pretty girls 'round me everywhere that I go
We made it out the streets, pop a bottle, let's make a toast
I run circles 'round square niggas with a blindfold
She said, "Let's make love", want me to fuck with my eyes closed (What?)
But lil' mama so fine, when she took her clothes off
I went straight in it, both eyes closed
(You crazy, bruh)
Hah, wait a minute, I'm fresh as fuck, let me strike a pose (It's Dolph)
Hands down, iced up, white and rose gold (Yeah)
She walkin' 'round my penthouse in my Versace robe (Hah)
Since a juvenile, I stuck to the G code (Uh-huh)
Servin' out the kitchen, but I never touched the stove (Nah)
I told my bitch, "You mines now, you ain't gotta work"
Just keep it real and let's go spend the mils

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh? Fuck 'em)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed9Embed

Both (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Southside & Future]
Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I don't usually do this, but the drink has got me moody
Got me thinking 'bout decisions, man, I shoulda left with Juve
Got me busting with my cutie, I can't trust her nor her booty
Every night, she acting new-school, I am not gon' be a student
I got class, I got trash, I got bills, I got pills
Heard them boys gon' write me off, I hope they also writing they wills
I got beam, I got flash, I got dreams and nightmares past
I'm allergic to the *brrrr*, I'm using wings to wipe my ass
Right now, I'm high as shit, I'm on the Bumbu, straight
I just got out my bitch, felt like the Sunken Place
She give me drunken face, she give me highest praise
And when I'm in LA, I'm smoking Kobe Bryant eighths
I watched my father whip the yay up like some mayonnaise
Moms would come home, they would argue, he didn't put away the plates
Taught me how to do my dirt and clean up at the same time
Right now, I'm on a couple percs and leaning at the same time
Remix, baby! Tunechi
[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn, these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, hoe, pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you, but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty, but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

Take it, FATBOI

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rockstar lifestyle, might don't make it (Wasted)
Living life high, every day, clique wasted (Wasted)
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanky (Wasted)
Wake in the morning, ten o'clock drinking (Wasted)
"Party, party, party!" Let's all get wasted (Wasted)
Shake it for me, baby girl, do it butt-naked (Wasted)
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted (Wasted)
Tell the bartender, "send me twenty more cases!"
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Geeking like Whitney, geeking like Britney (Wasted)
Gucci no hippie, but he stoned like Jimmy (Jimmy)
X-pill poppers, geeked up crazy (Crazy)
Whole clique rolling, everyone's wasted (Wasted)
Purple Codeine Sprite pink: don't waste it (Waste it)
Mix-up, grandma drink it, didn't taste it (Taste it)
Now grandma sipping syrup, leaning wasted
Walking around fucked up twisting her fingers

[Verse 2: Plies]
I don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm looking for a bitch to suck this Almond Joy
Say she got to stop sucking cause her jaws sore
Got a bitch on the couch, bitch on the floor (on the floor)
Your partner just popped another one, now he rolling more
Was on 3 pills, now he on 4
I don't know why, but that Remy turn me into a whore
Walked in the club, pocket full of big faces
Got that .40 on my waist and it's off safety
About 40 goons with me and we all wasted
On Remy straight tonight, dogg, no chaser

No shirts, fuck it! Our necks and arms are tatted
We sloppy drunk, disgusted, the liquor keep wasting (wasting)

Three red hoes walking round in red robes
Can't stay the night I'm not the type to be on Skype, ho
Wrote me off, said that I was gone, that was a typo
Take a white girl out a trailer make her Iggy
Take a black bitch outta Magic make her Nicki
Pissy yellow Rollie, baby pissy in her feelings
My young bitches show respect they call me Mr. Millions
Brown skin chick and she love to wear purple
Her nails purple, lips purple, pussy hair purple
Big titty Amazon in my black Benz
I'm rich black man got a couple white friends

Dance with the Devil Lyrics[Intro: Kodak Black]
Aye, Lil Metro on that beat

[Chorus]
A hundred grand'll make a nigga cool, wanna dance with the devil
Get the gloves and the shovel, he's tryna dance with the devil
A ghetto superstar make a bitch want to dance with the devil
When she glance at the bezel, she wanna dance with the devil
Diamonds on a nigga neck dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my wrist and fist dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my pinky ring dancing, dancing
Big booty bitch keep dancing, dancing
Real trap niggas take chances, flirting with the devil slow dancing
Real street bitches take chances, flirting with the devil romancing
Dancing
[Verse 1]
Dancing all night ten grand make you dance, dance
Hundreds in my pants turn your chick to my girlfriend
Gucci in the batter's box I just walked out the bullpen
Pitching dog food, make a junkie out your husband
Hundred stacks'll make 'em shoot you clean in your dad hat
Catch you at the trap and shoot you clean out your Hellcat
Everybody wanna be the kingpin, man
The feds snatched 'em up, now we ain't seen this man
2017, everybody get high
Taking street drugs like they ass can't die
And I ain't tryna preach 'cause I got high too
I'm an ex-drug dealer, nigga how 'bout you
I'm an ex-con, ex-hood, long with a dope bomb
Niggas don't make twenty-one where I come from (Wow)
Took a chance and fucked a hood hoe, no condom
Took a chance and put a price tag on your loved one

[Chorus]
A hundred grand'll make a nigga cool, wanna dance with the devil
Get the gloves and the shovel, he's tryna dance with the devil
A ghetto superstar make a bitch want to dance with the devil
When she glance at the bezel, she wanna dance with the devil
Diamonds on a nigga neck dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my wrist and fist dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my pinky ring dancing, dancing
Big booty bitch keep dancing, dancing
Real trap niggas take chances, flirting with the devil slow dancing
Real street bitches take chances, flirting with the devil romancing
Dancing
[Verse 2]
Tattoos all over but she bougie
Acting stiff but her booty keep choosing
In every neighborhood there's a Gucci
The neighborhood dealer with an Uzi
Baby started off right as a good girl
Now she's tryna act hard like a hood girl
Tryna catch a nigga playing for the Falcons
But steady sucking up the nigga with the dragons
Diamonds on my neck and wrist lit, it's a combo
Yellow bitch, her dark skin friend, call it gumbo
Pull up in a lot and the car cost a condo
Leave with your chick but send her back with a grand though
Yeah, yeah, it's Gucci Mane and Metro
If Metro don't trust you I'ma foot you in your asshole
Yeah, I started from the bando
I took her to the 6 but no, that's not Toronto

[Chorus]
A hundred grand'll make a nigga cool, wanna dance with the devil
Get the gloves and the shovel, he's tryna dance with the devil
A ghetto superstar make a bitch want to dance with the devil
When she glance at the bezel, she wanna dance with the devil
Diamonds on a nigga neck dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my wrist and fist dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my pinky ring dancing, dancing
Big booty bitch keep dancing, dancing
Real trap niggas take chances, flirting with the devil slow dancing
Real street bitches take chances, flirting with the devil romancing
