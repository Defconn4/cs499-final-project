​gone girl Lyrics[Intro: iann dior & Trippie Redd]
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: iann dior]
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fucking with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl

[Verse 1: iann dior]
Tell me what it is, made my heart break
Saying that it's me, but you know it ain't
Took a few pills, I can't feel a thing
Got me in my feels, sippin' on drank
Tryna keep it real, girl, you really ain't
You know what's the deal, you can't get a thing
Saying that it hurts, tryin' to the game
Saying I'm a joke, laughin' to the bank
[Pre-Chorus: iann dior]
I need your love
I need your touch
I need you right now
I need you right now

I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
I just want the love, baby, not the lust
Caught up in a daze, man, I need your trust
All up in a maze, left you in the dust
Gone in a wraith, see the stars in a wraith
You see the stars in the day, bitch
Have you been to Mars on a date, bitch?
I can take yo ass to Mars in a day, bitch
I can take yo ass to Mars today, bitch, yeah

I need your love
I need your touch

​emotions Lyrics[Chorus]
In my head, she said it's all in my head (My head)
But it's not, think I'd rather be dead (Be dead)

You did me wrong
And I can't forget that
Tell me what you want
I know it's a lie (Lie)
You broke my heart
And you cannot fix that

But certainly, all you do is burden me
It's hurting deep
Our past is like a blur to me
It's hard to see, but look what you have done to me

What you want from me?

What you want from me?
What you want?

But it's not, think I'd rather be dead (Be dead)
Can't forgive or forget what you did (You did)

Sick and Tired Lyrics[Intro: ​iann dior & Machine Gun Kelly]
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought, I guess I'll start again
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house (I am my only friend)

[Verse 1: ​iann dior]

Double cup, it got me stuck, I think I'm losin' it (Yeah)

There's a line inside my head (My head)
Of all my friends, that they've been dead since I made it out

[Pre-Chorus: iann dior]

I'm not sober again, but I'm tryna pretend
Like everything's alright but it's over with

I get drunk and interrupt, and my eyes look red
Because I'm mad at myself, I stab the openin'
Lately, everything I say you just tell me is wrong
I told her I won't be here long, I can't hold it in

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Every time you cross my mind
I burn another memory to keep yours inside
I saw us drown like high tide
And everything is nothing if you're not here tonight

[Chorus: ​iann dior & Machine Gun Kelly]
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought, I guess I'll start again

Over and over again, it's like I never win
Why you puttin' me down? It don't make any sense

Hey
Smoke, woah, woah-oh

Woah, woah-oh
(Ayy, KBeaZy, you fired up)
Yeah

[Chorus: iann dior]
Nowadays I get what I want
Lately been spendin' the bag
Addicted to gettin' that cash
Addicted to poppin' them tags
Money was made for the sad
Now my ex-bitch callin' back
Saw me come up out the random
Didn't wait long, now that bitch throwin' tantrums
Her friends fell in love when I fell into fame
In my DMs talkin' bout, "Hey, handsome"
I know that they hate me and want me for ransom
It's nothin' new, I won't give into that
I eat the hate up and spit it right back
My lyrics like bullets, I'm shootin' your ass
Women come and go with the cash
You gon' learn and learn that shit fast
They gon' fold, fold under act
I get my medicine straight out the back (Hey)
[Verse 1: iann dior]
I'm a prospect, not from Earth, I feel like a martian
'Matter fact, bitch, I came from a starship
My bed feel like a coffin, not wakin' up
If I run into opps, I'ma off 'em
I don't know if you think that you stoppin'
What I got goin' on, got a semi with auto on
This ain't no auto-correct, bitch, this a threat
Now I'm comin' at your neck
Niggas act cute like a pet
Soft like a Pop-Tart, act like they got no heart
Y'all be the ones that's pretending
Insecurities, they always offended
Mad about a bitch I already been in
That bitch for everybody, we ain't spoke in a minute
Niggas still in the picture, and I'm still leavin' with her
It ain't nothin', I'm a rebel

[Bridge: iann dior]
I can't conform, I ain't fallin' back, no
She need more, she got too attached, huh
Addicted to me like I'm on one
Three thousand for that new Rick Owens
Walk around, look like a mummy
Psychedelics hurt my tummy
Swipe, swipe, I'ma get it all (Yeah)
[Chorus: iann dior]
Nowadays, I get what I want
Lately, been spendin' the bag
Addicted to gettin' that cash

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Brand new Corvette, come through smashin' the gas (Skrrt)
They made me mad, now I'm back in my bag (I'm back)
I hope my main and my side never crash
Wide-body 'Cat, tryna dodge my past
We catch that boy, then we robbin' his ass
It's the principle, I don't need the cash
Expensive bitches, half a million on lashes
I could kick it, but I don't like to brag
Ho, they done made me mad, I'm 'bout to turn up (Turn it up)
I got my glizzy, wish a nigga run up
You can come get your bitch 'cause I don't want her
I ran my millions up from off the corner
I'm the one out here doin' what I wanna
My lil' bro ran it up off marijuana
Grind in the winter, turn up in the summer
Trackhawk with sport, I press it then I launch it
I'm thankin' God, ain't no more free lunches
Got suspended, me and greeny hundred
House up on the hill, I used to want it
Now I got it, I don't even stay there (Hey)
I get even, I don't play fair
Probably spend me a million on haters
On they top, make 'em drop
And I don't give a fuck 'bout no cops (Hey)

Nowadays I get what I want
Lately been spendin' the bag
Addicted to gettin' that cash
Addicted to poppin' them tags

I'm on the next flight out to come see you (I'ma see you)
Why we always gotta fight? Girl, I need you (Girl, I need you)
Quit playing with my mind, I can't read you (I can't read you)
Always saying that you're done, I don't believe you (I don't believe you)

I hate it when you say, "Goodbye" (Don't go)
Wish that I could hold you close (Don't go away)
Why we always gotta fight? (Don't go)
I'm on the way, I'm on a flight, yeah (Don't go away)

[Chorus]
I hate to see you cry, I should've brought you flowers (Woah, woah)
Now I'm alone, I should've stayed another hour (Woah, woah)
It's hard to breathe, someone send me help (Yeah)
I can't believe you left for someone else (Left for someone else)
You made me bleed and you just don't care (Don't care)
When you needed me, I was never there (I was never there)

​cutthroat Lyrics[Chorus]
I know, got a feeling that I might blow
Even though this industry is cutthroat
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane
Cutthroat, swear these bitches, they be cutthroat
I'm so low
Cruising through the city with my eyes closed
'Cause I'm losing my brain
Gotta keep on moving straight
Over, when you say it's over I'm not sober
Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane

[Verse 1]
They want to see me live
And I cannot forgive
Think I'm really going psycho
Thinking that I might blow
And I can't let you in
Baby, I can't forgive
Got me hanging on a tightrope
It's time for me to let go, 'cause
These drugs got me thinking that I need you
But I don't really need you
It's hard for me to see through
But now I see the real you
Like glass, I see right through you
Now why you acting new new, we both know what you wanna do
Shorty in my phone
But where you at?
Run off with my love, like you was a running back
But now I got you running back (Ayy, yeah)
Now I got you running back (Ayy, yeah)
[Chorus]
I know, got a feeling that I might blow
Even though this industry is cutthroat
Now I don't feel the same (Oh no)
Think these drugs drive me insane
Cutthroat, swear these bitches, they be cutthroat
I'm so low (So low)
Cruising through the city with my eyes closed
'Cause I'm losing my brain
Gotta keep on moving straight
Over, when you say it's over I'm not sober
Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane

[Verse 2]
They know we them niggas
And that's why they hate us
Only worry 'bout the money
So no you can't phase us
I can't never fall in love 'cause love is full of danger
You were my other half and now you are a stranger
Now I'm hard to reach, hard to find
In my line, all the time, every night
We living in a trippy life, I'm sad inside
So I really don't care to fight, enjoy the high
And now you want back in
But I can't let you in
Now you get to watch where I go
Got you going psycho
And no we can't be friends
And we can't make amends
Now it's time for you to let go
I'm just someone that you used to know
[Chorus]
I know, got a feeling that I might blow
Even though this industry is cutthroat
Now I don't feel the same (Oh no)
Think these drugs drive me insane (Oh no)
Cutthroat, swear these bitches they be cutthroat
I'm so low (So low)
Cruising through the city with my eyes closed
'Cause I'm losing my brain
Gotta keep on moving straight
Over, when you say it's over, I'm not sober
Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane11Embed

​don’t want to fall Lyrics[Intro]
Back at home

[Chorus]
Why should I try? When I know you'll choose the other guy
You a lie, on your fifth and probably switchin' sides
With a guy, that ain't gon' do shit for you but apply
For that nine to five, and you satisfied, why?
Hi, I'm that nigga that you won't forget, such a threat
See me up and now she wanna text
LAX, I just landed, I left all my friends
Back at home, feel alone

[Verse]
Making love, said she want my trust and that she ain't get enough, (What?)
You ain't gettin' none, bitch
I said we done, this shit not fun
And I'm not the one to be messin' with
I'm not the one you been flexin' with
I'm not the one, that's the end of it
Ain't no questioning
If I do, where was you
There's no end of it
You were heaven-sent, a lesson that I'm dealing with
[Bridge]
Oh-oh oh, you can't stop me
Oh-oh oh, heart so broken
Oh-oh oh, you can't fix it
Oh-oh oh, I been missing

​who cares Lyrics[Intro]
But who cares?
Not a damn soul
And that's why I
Hahahaha, Nick, you're stupid

You fail (Yeah), you fail (Yeah I know)
And who cares? Who cares?
Not a damn soul and that's why

I know you think about me and everything that we could have been
[Verse]
Won't say but I know
I've been on your mind
You've been creeping on the low (Low)
But summertime, you were all alive but then you went so cold
Made my heart freeze and I lost it
I don't know what you sayin', oh
Quit your crying
You've been lying and it's really startin' to show (I see it)
What you bend over fo'? Ain't no going back
Don't say sorry now
You know it's too late for that
You gon' make me laugh
I'ma make you sad
Keep that for your next
'Cause now I'm flexin' with these bands on me
You a fan, diamonds dance
Enough said I move happily (Yeah)
Smoking gas, there's no gravity
Feelings go away (Away)
Moving to a different state
But you wouldn't know anyway

You not the one, you just for fun, you not my slime (No, no)
Not the one for me (No, no)

​let you Lyrics[Chorus]
This time I know, I know, I know
There's no looking back, it's all in the past
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, you keep saying
You hate me
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, so I'll let you

[Verse 1]
I let you do what you want and now you airing me out
They say a girl is a gun, but don't tempt me
'Cause I'm taking a chance, put the gun in my hands
Playing Russian Roulette 'til she's empty
No, no, I don't wanna die young
Don't wanna die young and hopeless
So, so, if I'm gonna die young
Just in case I die young, I wrote this
[Pre-Chorus]
All these changes
Fuck it, don't make me play this
Brеak up, make up
And we do it again

[Chorus]
This time I know, I know, I know
Thеre's no looking back, it's all in the past
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, you keep saying
You hate me
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, so I'll let you

[Verse 2]
She's the poster that I'm hanging in my mind, right
She's so sweet, but she caught me on my blind side
You know it's true, I'm fucked up too
But you know I'm always coming back for you
'Cause every time I see you, make me wanna rewind
Love went sour so I'm throwing up a peace sign
You know it's true, I'm bad for you
That's just some shit that I've been going through

[Pre-Chorus]
All these changes
Fuck it, don't make me play this
Break up, make up
And we do it again
[Chorus]
This time I know, I know, I know
There's no looking back, it's all in the past
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, you keep saying
You hate me
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, so I let you13Embed
