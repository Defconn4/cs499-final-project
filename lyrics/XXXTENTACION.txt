Yeah

[Chorus]

Jocelyn Flores Lyrics[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty—

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you so well (I know you, girl)
I mean, I can do better than he can
I've been pretty—
I know you so well798Embed

Revenge Lyrics[Intro]
I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?

[Verse]
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Well, broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
[Chorus]
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot

Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why

Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

I spoke to the devil in miami, he said everything would be fine Lyrics[Intro]
It will all be over soon

[Verse]
And I'm always where the sun don't shine, the
Tears don't show, won't hurt me now 'cause
Heart's been broke, I hate myself, but
It won't show, I constantly lose all
My remorse, and it's ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd, and it's one for the sheep who
Led by your leopard, often gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer, now I'm trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze, couldn't control the pace
Where is this going, hey? Heartless is recklessness, it's
Word of a pacifist to word of a masochist, I'm
Off of the map, My Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I gave him one thing he needed
"What is this thing?", I pleaded; boy, it's the key to even, yeah
[Outro]
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"

Riot Lyrics[Intro]
(Luke White on the beat)

[Verse]
You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like a task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot, then bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', "Fuck it," and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children? Makes you a chump
Look in all the stores you wreckin', nigga, I reckon
Think about the people who own it for 'bout a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But sure, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck the black prejudice
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views,” and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion, all cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder opps, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em, murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say, "Fuck it," and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin', go 'head and grab the extension
Give death another one, uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black
[Outro]
We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings (We are the Ku Klux Klan, we hate)255Embed

I'm green like a spinach, I don't know you, then it's pay, ayy (Ooh)
Hummanah hummana, back fist, out my way, ayy (Ayy)
No Chris Brown (Oh), fuck her, make her look at me now (Wet)
When I'm in the pussy, say "Ow!"
You got no etiquette, just beginnin' like Genesis
Can you give me a rapper that I'm not better than, mmph? (Ayy)
Revenge jeans, I think that I might OD
On sauce, I don't rock Supreme
Suck my dick, Squidward's clarinet
Brought to life like I’m Evanescence
Wanna wake, w-w-wake, w-w-wake, okay, like
Big black (Black), dick in your mama mouth
Pull it back, push her whole wig back (Wig)
Tic, tac, your breath really P-U
Yo, you really need a Tic-Tac (Stank)
Big pump, Cobain, Cobain
Leave a pussy nigga with no brain, okay (Blaow)
Weenie Hut Jr. looking boy, tell him "Ole"
I'ma pull that pistol, make 'em Mr. Noodle, ayy
[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I feel like Nick Cannon (Nick), huh
'Cause I'm wildin' out ('Cause I'm wildin'), huh
I don't got on Vans (I don't got 'em)
But bitch, I'm off the wall (I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't)
Huh, feel like Nick Cannon (Feel like Nick), huh
'Cause I'm wildin' out ('Cause I'm, huh), huh
I don't got on Vans, but bitch, I'm off the wall (Wall, wall, water)
I said like insect (Ew), I be buggin' motherfucker (Ow)
Fuck on your mommy
My flow be sick like that bitch gotta vomit, to vomit, to vomit (Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta)
I'm hot like a comet
Insect, I be buggin' motherfucker (Insect)
Fuck on your mommy (Uh-huh)
My flow be sick like that bitch gotta vomit, to vomit, to vomit
I'm hot like a comet (Sick, sick, sick, ayy)70Embed

I should've let you know that you're my only one

You want me in your bed, 'cause I've been in your head

'Cause you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna

​infinity (888) Lyrics[Intro: Joey Bada$$ & XXXTENTACION]
—ggas will be like "Yo, these niggas is wildin' right now
Like, these niggas is really wildin'", you know what I'm sayin'?
Like, we ain't playin' with y'all niggas, man, ya heard?
Sometimes you just gotta catch chlamydia on these niggas, G-shit
You know what I'm sayin'? Gonorrhea, all that shit
All of that shit
I catch all diseases in the world
So the world don't have no more diseases, you feel me?
G-shit
Yeah, yeah
(P. Soul on the track)

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I'm as real as they come, they feel it, get numb
You think you got a little buzz, so now you can't get stung?
I keep a razor blade tucked on me, under my tongue
Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of the hardest ever (Yeah)
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas (Bang)
And bomb whatever, say we don't move calmly, never (No)
This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort
No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxin' these niggas extra
This the Pro of all Eras, he's back in your sector
So, might be best to protect your neck
Or profess your debt to the god, he might bless ya
[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Murder these flows like I murder these ho ass niggas
Where the fuck is your energy, bro?
Make your nigga deepthroat a Desert Eagle
If he try me like a ho, pussy boy, that's on my soul
Make my flow shapeshift, cold expression like a facelift
At the publix with like eight grips if you talkin' all that ape shit
I'm not talkin' YMBAPE shit, but I'm bangin' on my chest, bitch
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Travelin' through the infinity, uh
You not that nigga, pretend to be, uh
All that bullshit do not get to me, uh
I am a spirit, an entity, uh
You just wan suck up my energy, uh
I am the realest since Kennedy, uh
You pussy ass niggas fuckin' suck, you sound the same
I spit the pain, that's why these young niggas feel the same
They know I bang, I'll pull a fuckin' pistol out the Range and act insane

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Joey Bada$$]
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
So I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more (Yeah)
I don't feel the pain (Ayy) no more (Ayy)120Embed
