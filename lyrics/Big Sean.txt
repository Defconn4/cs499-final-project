Control Lyrics[Produced by No I.D.]

[Intro: Big Sean]
Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that "Juicy" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast
[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far623Embed

Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, uh
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic (Woah)
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
Brr brr, I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, "I don't fuck wit'-
Chu, bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah
And every day I wake up celebratin' shit, why?
‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch, I
Stuck to my guns (Woah,) that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here, that's what made me this (This)
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on (Swerve)
And then another one text (Swerve, swerve,) then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like—

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't fuck wit' you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu

Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass
[Chorus: Big Sean, E-40]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a (E-40)
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do (Hawoo)
I don't give a fuck, uh

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online, limited amount of time
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich (Hella rich)
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio (Arsenio)
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless (Uh,) you might end up domeless (Uh)
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty (Mmm)
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth (Pour up)
Why you always comin' around with bad news? (Bad news)
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose (Hope I lose)
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew (Crew,) but them niggas cool (Cool)
It's just that—
[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean, E-40]
I don't fuck wit' you (Lil' biatch)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu (Uh-uh)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus (Extended): Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do (You)
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for (God)
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for (Swerve, swerve, swerve)
Yeah, I got a lot, but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor (Floor)
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up (Uh)
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up (Uh)
That shit can break ya down, if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up (Yup)
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious (Woah,) feel me
When you get a fine bitch, just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma too real, so I hope you doin' cool
But still—

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
No, no, no, no
Little stupid ass, I ain't fuckin' wit' (Woah)
I ain't fuckin', I ain't, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu (Woah)
I ain't fuckin' wit'chu, ha
Straight up, yeah, yeah
Woah

Blessings Lyrics[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... up)
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God
[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough
I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doing this shit, man
[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I
[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed
[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God, I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled, I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school, a Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh, yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed1.4KEmbed

Bounce Back Lyrics[Intro: Future]
Hitmaka
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one

Beware Lyrics[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying "Fuck you," "I miss you," or "I hate you so much"
'Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say "Be real," I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying
[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa, ew, time, kill, months, still

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy (Yup)
I drank too much, please call me a cabby (Swerve)
Penthouse afterparty, hoes want the addy (Swerve)
Fuck, they can ride with us, crawl in the Caddy
Third row, that's when you call, I hit cancel
Really, I hit answer, fuck, I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, "Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga, I don't even have you
How I'm supposed to get past you?"
Then she called the next guy, spillin' some real shit
Now they problems that he got to deal with
[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Mwah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "Ain't no woman like the one I got!"
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Lil Wayne, Big Sean, Jhené Aiko & Lil Wayne]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart (Tunechi)
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start (Damn)
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart
[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy234Embed

Ass so fat, all these bitches’ pussies is throbbin’
Bad bitches, I’m your leader, Phantom by the meter
Somebody point me to the best ass eater
Tell 'em "Pussy clean" I tell them "Pussy squeaky"
Niggas give me brain ’cause all of them niggas geeky
If he got a Mandingo, then I buy him a dashiki
And bust this pussy open in the islands of Waikiki
Kiss my ass and my anus, ’cause it’s finally famous
And it’s finally soft, yeah, it’s finally solved
I don’t know, man, guess them ass shots wore off
Bitches ain’t poppin’, Google, my ass
Only time you on the net is when you Google my ass
Y-y-you fuckin’ little whores, fu-fuckin’ up my decors
Couldn’t get Michael Kors if you was fuckin’ Michael Kors
B-B-Big Sean, b-boy, how big is you
Give me all your money and give me all your residuals
Then slap it on my ass, ass, ass
[Chorus: Both Big Sean & Nicki Minaj]
Ass ass ass ass ass
Ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass
Ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass
Stop! Now make that motherfucker hammer time like
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid

Woah, white girls, black girls, tall girls, fat girls
Shake that ass shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass, shake that ass, shake that ass
Go, go
Short girls, small girls, skinny girls, all girls
Shake that ass shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass, shake that ass, shake that ass
And I want all of that

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ass ass ass ass ass
Ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass
Ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass
Stop! Now make that motherfucker hammer time like
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid

No Favors Lyrics[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (Brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, "Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too."
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons (Fuck 'em!)
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America, I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30 so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power—how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit: I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the G.O.A.T. while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
Trump's a bitch, I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "wait," pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Outro]
(I know you feeling yourself right now)
(But I'm not sure she's the one—I wouldn't call her, man)
"Hey, I'm outside"
What are you doing here?

I Know Lyrics[Produced by DJ Mustard & Key Wane]

[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh-huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
Uh-huh, I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes
That y'all don't speak the same language
Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs
Wanna get away, baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up out of town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwestern
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be the baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just gotta cast it

[Bridge: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing but no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I know you, I know you
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you want a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been
[Outro: Big Sean]
I know it look like like you need a vacation
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia
Take you places other niggas can't take ya
Don't forget the makeup, yeah431Embed

One Man Can Change the World Lyrics[Produced by Amaire Johnson]

[Intro: Big Sean]
They used to tell me, used to tell me

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my stepbrother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million-dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, "Ain't too much that's different"
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My grandma told me, "If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white-out"
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...
[Chorus: John Legend]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world
[Outro: Grandma & Big Sean]
Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about you
It's all good, I love you grandma

Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it 'til it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see (What you see)

I always wanted to stunt so hard (Yeah,) I always wanted to ride that whip (Always)
I always wanted to fuck that bitch (I always,) thank you, God, I fucked that bitch (God)
I always wanted to live this life (Life,) I always wanted to wear that ice (All this ice)

Now it don't take a lot to make you rich (To make you rich)

But I feel like money is the best drug (Best drug)
Sometimes hate can be the best love
[Verse 1]
Walkin' in like I got cameras on me, niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie, got a pretty young girl, look like Janet on me (Word)
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers ‘til we crash up the whole database (Word)
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base (Yeah,) closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes (Yeah)
What you think this life just landed on me? My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes (Yeah,) every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances, back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic, even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie, I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie, making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed, so fuck is my ransom, homie?

Money bag, money bag, money bag

Room lookin' like it's fumigated, bitch, my crew invaded, when I walk in, man, they body to body
Hol' up everybody, don't worry, man, I got it, I got it, I need a hundred dollar bill, photocopy the email and copy

Lit for your love baby, lit for your love

Lit for your love baby (Straight up!)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
That's that don't play! Whuh! That's that new Ye
People sayin' I'm the closest thing to Mike since Janet, whuh!
Tom Cruise, homie, we jumpin' up on them couches
That's a fresh house, is that a guest house?
Your house got another house?
Your bitch got a bitch, your spouse got another spouse
Young Walt Disney, I'ma tell you truthfully
If you leave Mickey you gon' end up with a Goofy
I imagine that's what Chris told Karrueche
Girls be actin' like it's diamonds in they coochie
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
But cops chokin' niggas out in the media
We finna have to protest and tear the city up
We 'bout to tear this whole place up, pretty much
(How much I live)

[Bridge: Kanye West]
And you know it's all your fault
Nobody, nobody, nobody, babe
You know it's all your fault
Nobody, nobody, nobody, but me

Hoe, we done made it through hell and disaster
My crib done got bigger, my women got badder
You wonderin', "How do you get in the game?"
I'm wonderin', "How do I get to the rafters?"
Oh boy, I'm mad until these records gettin' shattered
'Til I'm MJ or Magic, ooh, and she just want the status
So, you the man she got, but I'm the man that she been after
She done sent so many naked pics, my phone ain't got no data
I walk off in New York like my name Derek Jeter
Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina (Gina!)
I'm the good with the evil; fuck you, nice to meet you
You can't have a peace sign, man, without the middle finger
With the clique when you see us, that's my family to me
That's my family tree, they're my arms, legs, hands, and my feet
And I can't cut them off with even diabetes
Hit the beat and kerosene it; scratch that, I white sheet it
A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us
Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar
Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's
Got me thinkin' back bout how I used to roll to Little Caesars
Piece of pizza with Tanisha now I'm with a Boniqua
She finna blow at that
I got your dream girl, yeah, she actin' like a hoe at that
Throw her to me, I'ma throw that back
Top spot, I'm finna go at that (Straight up)
[Chorus: Kanye West & Travis Scott (Ambrosia)]
(I live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love

Lit for your love baby, lit for your love

Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby (Straight up!)

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hoe, you gotta move quick
World in my hands, I ain't gotta loose grip
I don't like loose pussy or loose lips
And I done did the impossible a few times, Tom Cruise shit
Hoe, and I ain't satisfied bein' on that top five list
I ain't satisfied until I'm on that all-time list
Til everything I spit is all timeless
My girl on that all fine list
My life a little luck, a lot of grind, bitch!
No "maybe," hoe, I gotta make it
Fuck your nomination; man, fuck the world
I'm repopulatin', wrap my Rollie round my waist
Yeah, time's a-wastin'
Niggas want the comma-comma-combination
Long as I'm around, it's gon' be dot-dot-dot, a lot of waitin'
Got my pinky on her brain while I'm gettin' brain
Plottin' world domination, people ask me how to make it
I'm just like "man, if you want the crown, bitch, you gotta take it"

Yeah
Sex game had her ass blowing me up (brrr)
Sex game had her ass texting me up

Whoa

[Chorus]
I got the moves

[Verse]
Look, give me the ball and I won't have to pass it
I ain't passing out until I'm asthma attacking
I take a plan and then I back-to-back it
Hit after hit, check the batting average
I take the work, flip it, acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition, hm, not a challenge
I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch
Packed out, but I can count on my hands who I'ma talk to in this bitch
Girls from law school in this bitch
Yeah, they paralegals
Barely 21, that's very legal
But they doing shit that's probably barely legal, aw, man
It's that nigga that you probably least expected
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top five getting redirected
From here on out, it'll be consecutive
We making moves like Tarantino, like J.J. Abrams
Moving like Channing Tatum
Moving like Jason Statham
Motherfuck the whole industry
Half of these niggas my mini-me's
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
You hot for a minute, me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth, man, that shit like a gym to me, don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility, look
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away
Stay away, or your ass might get K.O., kay today
Man, that "pew! pew!" hit your ass from like way, a-ways, away
[Chorus]
I got the moves
I got the moves (whoa)
I'm making moves
You gotta move (you gotta move)
She make that back move (damn)
She made her titties move (goddamn)
I make the city move (like whoa)

I got the moves (I'm making-)
I got the moves (I got the moves)

You gotta move (you gotta-)

She made her titties move (goddamn)
I make the city move (I do)
I make the city move (yeah I do)

[Outro]
Look, I'm a Don, I'm a Don, I'm a Don (Don)

Sacrifices Lyrics[Intro: Big Sean & Future]
Brrrt!
I look up, so many (On my don shit)
So, so many
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I done made sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (Straight, straight up)
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free
Fuck it, I sacrificed it (Fuck it, I sacrificed it)
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (Straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices (Woah)
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Fuck what you telling me, I sense the jealousy
I got telepathy, I got the recipe
I got the streets and I don’t got no felonies
Forward thinking, yeah my mind is ahead of me
Momma said it's gonna be whatever you let it be
It's some homies I grew up with that's dead to me
It's some niggas that I just met in debt to me
What's in common is they both pay respect to me
I get it my way from Friday to Friday
My girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade
I came a long way from that "Marvin and Chardonnay"
I pull out the driveway like I’m in a car chase speeding!
And if my bitch cheat she know I’m leaving!
No text, no call boy
That bitch airplane mode, cold
No peacoat, no time to change clothes
Same clothes, love if you living by the same code
G-code, leave ho
Fuck it you dead to me, back to my destiny
Penthouse, birds eye view, that's a nest for me
I got my self out of debt
So when you see me, know you're somebody I'll never need

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (Straight, straight up)
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free (Free)
Fuck it, I sacrificed it (Fuck it, I sacrificed it)
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (Straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices (Woah)
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah
[Bridge: Big Sean]
I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy
Focused on the inner me, never on the enemy
And I done sacrificed my own time, I done sacrificed my own mind
I done sacrificed the club life, I done sacrificed my love life
Look, I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy
Focused on the inner me, never on the enemy
And I done sacrificed my own time, I done sacrificed my own mind
I done sacrificed the club life, I done sacrificed my love life

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
I done sacrificed the thug life (Hey), diamonds shining ain't no dull life (Shine)
Drop my top to get my mind right (Skrt), pull up in the 'Rari, loud pipes (Skrr)
Bitch, I'm the don, my wrist a hundon (Patek)
Ooh, yeah, Gucci python (Yeah)
Ooh, yeah, she play with her tongue
Yeah, I bought that bitch a new charm (Woo)
Lit nigga pop one, I told her come see about me (Come on, come see me)
The devil had entered my soul, my momma had beat it out me (The devil, my momma)
Remember my grandmama had told me you better be somebody (Be somebody)
Hop in my seats massaging (Ah!)
Watch how I lead the posse (Come on), I made an M deposit (Hey)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Paid all these dues with the game (Yeah yeah)
Sacrificed yo stripes for that stain (Sacrifice)
Heard you sacrificed your life for that chain (Yeah yeah)
She sacrificed that money for cocaine (White, phew, coco)
Left hand got three rings, that's Bron Bron, we up one
Bad bitch she a savage, take her to the mall and buy her something (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's gonna wanna make your friends come (Yeah, hey)
Make way with the tommy gun (Tommy gun, brrt)
Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice? (Woo, woo)
Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice? (Hey)
Ten toes, yeah, you gotta stay down, ayy (Woo)
Just some young niggas looking for a way out, ayy (Woo)
People watchin', yeah, I gotta skip town, ayy (Woo)
Hit my phone if you need a whole pound, ayy
[Chorus: Big Sean]
I done made sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (Straight, straight up)
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free (Free)
Fuck it, I sacrificed it (Fuck it, I sacrificed it)
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (Straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices (Woah)
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Big Sean & Quavo]
I know my great, great, great aunty was a slave (I know)
I could only imagine all the sacrifice she made (I can only imagine)
I could only imagine all the shit she had to take (I can only imagine)
I'ma make sure all the blood she gave wasn't in vain (Damn)
I sacrificed for your entertainment boy, I'm Mr. Anderson in the Matrix
Check the last name it's all facts and the human race is all about pacing (Damn)
Look at all the ones I outlasted, I'm the one at the end like I count backwards
Never satisfied, details classified 'til the afterlife, make a sacrifice, Don (Don)
Why can’t y’all recognize that we all came from sacrifice?
Why can’t y’all recognize that we all came from sacrifice?57Embed

Friday Night Cypher Lyrics[Intro: Tee Grizzley]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
(Hit-Boy)
Ayy, this that Clipse sample, ayy (G. Ry got me)
Fuck that talkin', let the clip slam 'em

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley & Kash Doll]
Yellow bands around them hundreds, you know how much that is (Tens)
Too much to give me cash, they had to wire me the backend (Send it)
Niggas in here lookin' tough, you know that I got mag in (What?)
Ask me am I only rappin', you know I got that bag in (You see it)
Bandman like Lonnie (Lonnie), want my head? Come find me (Come get it)
Lil' bro in that bitch chillin', he ain't tryna come home cocky (He chillin')
He comin' home to a dollar (Dollar), and a mansion and a chopper (What else?)
In the desert on a dirt bike (Skrrt), VLONE shirt and the Pradas (Fresh)
Big nigga fresher than you, fuck you and your stylist (Woah)
Paid ninety for my grill, then lost it, that's why I ain't smilin' (Damn)
You got Sean, you got Hit, you got Grizz
Kash Doll'll paint you red, throw you in the water, they gon' think you a lobster, nigga
Gang (Uh)
[Verse 2: Kash Doll]
I just dropped a kit, you dropped out of school
These hoes wanna be famous 'til they make the news
All my bitches winnin', how it feel to lose?
Nigga tryna get the box like he finna move
Bitch, I'm at my pinnacle, I used to shop at Pinnacle
Your nigga still drink Pinnacle, bitch, your taste is pitiful
I talk cash shit, you ain't cash shit
Call up Baby Choppa, Cash Kidd, and spend my cash, kid
You stay back like adlibs, I buy, I don't ask shit
I pop shit and pop tags, bitch, this new era be cappin', uh
Me, Sean, Tee off that Pusha T, ain't no pushin' me
Bro might put you on a tee, dot my I's and cross my T's
Bro might put you six feet or bro gon' put you on your feet
But bro can't put you onto me
A-plus pussy worth a B, nigga, uh
You niggas ain't worth no B, fuck outta here

[Verse 3: Cash Kidd & Payroll Giovanni]
I keep dyin' in my dreams, but life's great when I stay woke
Bet you love dreamin', that's the only time you ain't broke
Try me, 40 make you back up off me like DeJ Loaf and Big Sean
Get triggered down, Jhené Aiko
Gotta keep Glock in the fanny
Nigga, you not finna ham me, huh
Put a body on a ratchet, I feel like Dr. Miami
Niggas tryna ride my wave like they stoppin' a taxi
On a six in a Lam', but I'm not that bitch Mary (Helluva made this beat, baby, Four-One)
[Verse 4: Payroll Giovanni]
They counted me out, I came back with a vengeance
In back-to-back Benzes, back-to-back winnin'
Rap failed, oh well, give me back my scale
And a burn-out cell, I'll grow clientele (Yup)
Four-One P, I don't sell dreams, I wholesale P's (Uh)
Want halves, nigga, don't call me, don't insult me (Boy)
Wrist frosty, 'bout eighty what this shit cost me
Don't worry, I'll make it back before you sip coffee
I run with hustlers and bosses, bosses and hustlers (Yeah)
Had to find my hustle, I was lost in the gutter
Got out that jam, now it's foreigns with the seats peanut butter
Bitch, it's BYLUG for life, never crossin' my brothers

[Interlude]
(Let's go)
(Helluva made this beat, baby)

[Verse 5: 42 Dugg]
I fuck with 6 Mile, not too much the 7, they freed the 4s
That's your bitch, huh? Well, get her together, she fuckin' bro
You know them road trips still bring a dub in, sub in
Even if the party was seven, the strip club ten
I'm all in this bitch on the tether, I'm throwin' dubs still
I put her in the Bentley mansion rent-free
Told 'em keep the G-Wagon plain, don't even tint these
Can't be fuckin' with a lame, dog, you got her head big
Three hundred a line for the Wock', I'm sippin' red still
I know how the feds feel, I make it hard to catch me
Cuz sellin' corn still, codeword for reggies
I ain't signed a deal yet, fuck it, I don't need 'em
Everybody with me eatin', free my niggas 'til I see 'em
He ain't dead, we ain't even, Jet back, ante up, bitch
Free them boys
[Interlude]
(Shit hard)
(Where you at, Bo?)

[Verse 6: Boldy James]
We gon' make it off the ave, get a half, then I shake it
Somethin' like a bad habit, we ain't have it, we gon' take it
Came up off a fifty slab, now my bag big as yappers
Workers beggin' me for time off, askin' me for raises
Took me six hours to count it, bubble wrap it up, and tape it
All my bitches want allowance, plug askin' me for favors
I been out of town so long, had to get reacquainted
With the neighbors on the block, all this cash we been rakin'

[Verse 7: Drego & Big Sean]
Way before the rap when I was writin' verses
We was beatin' up the Ike like I was Tina Turner
We was loadin' up the Glock and fillin' up the hearses
Now I'm preachin' like it's Sunday, tryna teach the sermon
Tryna teach 'em how to get it, fill up they mamas' purses
So they ain't standin' front the judge, listen to the verdicts
'Cause we was standin' on the block, thuggin' with the serpents (Yeah)
Get caught with Kurtis Blow on me and they gon' close the curtains

[Verse 8: Big Sean]
Million-dollar calls you can't merge in, BasedGod how I got my curse lift
She gon' play her part so well, you thought that she rehearsed it
Don life worship
Holy temple, synagogue, tabernacle, churches

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Yeah (Hit-Boy)
Look

[Verse 9: Big Sean]
I can't even chill, I get active
Overdoin' everythin' my best and worst habit
Shit be impossible 'til it happens
I never thought I'd see Kobe go before Magic
That taught me first, no seconds to waste
Only waist I like is her legs wrapped around my face
Fuck you think she doin' over here? Watchin' Netflix?
Beard game, might just let it grow down to my necklace, uh
I don't hope for wins, I expect it, uh
Adrenaline in me like it got injected
My girl say I got communication issues, no, I don't
I just don't like sharin' all my problems more than the results
I bring the plan back to my team, tell 'em go wild
Godbody my physique and my profile
I did every single goal that I wrote down
Checked it off, it's old now
And that shit give me chills, fuck I gotta take yours?
I'm the originator, make it, then I make more
Written in stone, you can't forge
You ain't on my level even if we in the same buildin' on the same floor
Old boy black out
Dough boy cash out, payroll, contract maxed out
Cash kid, cash cow
Tapped in, I can't tap out
Bitch, keep thinkin' I'm sleepin' in
Tony on the monitor, I see your ass creepin' in
Lil' bitch, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't exist, you get the gist?
Fuck a cease and desist, they shootin' up seats and exits
Throwin' plays to my bros, I'm leadin' the league in assists
Hopscotch, blacktop, I ain't been skippin' a step since
Real estate, Zillow every day, bitch, I might just change my profession
Dodged so many rainy days, it changed my complexion
Hang up on your ass and say I lost the connection
I turned out to be the man that I manifested

[Interlude: Big Sean]
(Let's go then)

[Verse 10: Sada Baby]
Hmm, fuck the bullshit
I ain't here to make no friends, can't get bool with me
Since an adolescent, I was ignorant, up in school trippin'
Pistol at my desk, I was sittin' up in school with it
Put your bitch hand in my corner pocket, play pool with it
She gon' eat the dick, both balls licked, and do it to me
Ain't go to college, I ain't want no pussy nigga roomin' with me
Still could've went to college, Sada ain't no fool, nigga
Every clip we got extended, yellow Perkies look like minions
Put Church's Chicken on your niggas, scrape them boys for half a biscuit
Know I like the burner, but I'll beat your ass, this shit personal, huh
Hit a nigga in his shit with this fifty or thirty, duh

[Interlude: Big Sean]
(Let's go, Royce)

[Verse 11: Royce da 5'9"]
Name a nigga out of the D as solid as me
I unlocked a lot of dollars, nigga, knowledge is key
I did it all without a college degree
I went from hottest signed artists, don dada, to G
Street lord, rock bottom, Godfather, and P
D-Boy, Rottweiler, Sean, Sada, and Tee
Standin' on the corner three days
Phone is on Motorola prepaid
Diadora or gold Ellesses
These are ordered from the older East Bays
She either rollin' with the owners or the lessees
A kind man knows a blind man holds grudges
A wise man knows a wise man knows nothin'
I thought I told you motherfuckers I ain't need a budget
I ride with them guys that society begrudges
We been thuggin' worldwide, got arenas buzzin'
We survived gettin' fronted by Ilena cousin
Before you could sell that Cole and Adele
Or go NFL, be Kobe or Kells
The plight of the rich is to throw you in jail
The fight has been fixed since the openin' bell
And you know who postin' your bail? Who promotin' your L?
Who be hopin' you fail? Nigga, Oprah and Gayle
Ignore the hate, show the world that we love the opps
Call Lyor great while they make rape Russell docs
Nah

[Interlude]
(Okay, yeah)
(Hit-Boy)
Yeah
(G. Ry got me)

[Verse 12: Eminem]
Bitch, you have never said a clever line ever
You murdering in the booth is the furthest thing from the truth
Rest assured, I'ma treat this roof like I'm peelin' off (What?)
The plastic on a pill bottle, I'm tearin' the ceilin' off, yeah
Ripping rappers like they were wrapped in Saran, bitch
And I'm strapped up with ammunition
And single-handedly takin' over the game like I had an actual hand missing
But I only need one to clap
Animal ambition
The only butt-fuckin' way that you're strapped is for cash
Wish you could slap in the damn clip in that motherfuckin' imaginary little handgun you're brandishin'
Bitch, if you pull up with the stick
It's a car with a manual transmission
The chances are low to none that I will overcome my bipolar one
Voodoo dolls, I'm just pokin' fun, pins to me are like loaded guns
When I'm holdin' one, if I'm just fiddlin' with it
This motherfucker discharges like me checkin' myself out of the fucking mental hospital
And I get off like an acquittal, I spit it, you critique it
It feels like I'm bein' belittled by midgets
It's like holding a nuke or a damn bazooka
And walkin' right up in the middle of a little kids' fuckin' pillow fight with it
You want smoke? I'm like hookah
Man, I remember back when I used to get jumped for my fucking Pumas
Run home and go fuck my room up
These streets will try to vacuum you up
That's why the avenue where I grew up was 8 Mile and Hoover (What?)
'Cause it sucked like a Roomba
But even if I would've went the indie route
I don't have any doubt
I would still get blown like it's windy out
Shoot 'til the clip is emptied out
This is the beginning of the ending, but I'll put another clip in and spit these rounds
If I dig deep down when I'm in my bag like Fendi
Who am I offending now?
Got so many fucking detractors, feels like I'm gettin' plowed
Had to put my money on a diet, I got too many pounds
You would think I'm turnin' pages the way that I'm flippin' paper
Middle fingers, them bitches get to wavin' like friendly neighbors
I'm talkin' loot like I'm rioting
Dick is so big, I can't fit the entire thing through a tire swing
I don't think it'd be logic for me to say that I'm retirin'
But I should say bye-bye, earthlings
'Cause I'm back on Uranus fuckin' up this "Grindin'" beat, yeah
I took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song
You listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart
So when I'm rippin', it's hard to tell whether if it is really because
Of how offensive I am, or just what a bitch that you are
Like I never had to get my clothes at fucking St. Vincent de Paul
Like I don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp, and I'm quick on the draw
Yeah, so when I pull it, surprise (Pull it, surprise), like Kendrick Lamar
You need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog
'Cause y'all are missing a heart
Plus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz
This shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping
Y'all got detention tomorrow
I'm severe like Benzo withdrawal
Bitch, your skin's gonna crawl
I'm invincible, I've been through it all
Like I never thought about just ending it 'til I got pissed off and put a fist through the wall
My back was against
Now I rap like I'm possessed, that's nine-tenths of the law
Oh
Oh, fuck it118Embed

Ashley Lyrics[Hook : Miguel]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you

[Verse 1 : Big Sean]
Yeah, I got a brand new Benz
Crazy right, brand new Benz
Got less miles on it than I do friends
Remember when we laid at you and Paige’s crib
Was there so long I coulda paid rent
Remember when we couldn’t get shit?
Best thing bout being broke is you don’t spend shit
Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list
We couldn’t afford nothin' but we still get shit
Ironically those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe its because I had you girl
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris
And gave each other times that we cherished
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower
And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed
See those are times I can’t let go, I can’t let go
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs
So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like “let’s go”
[Hook: Miguel & Big Sean]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you
Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful, distasteful
Yeah I know you’re not supposed to hate cake and eat too
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full
What about the emails you hacked in?
I know we hate to live in the past-tense
It’s been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D
And ain’t came back since
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city
That’s about the time that you left for the city
You and all your girls moved to NY
I shoulda’ known now how you watch Sex And The City
I know we ain’t close but, I gotta focus on blowing up
I know I promised that I’d be there, and really did I ever show up?
I know I wasn’t honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl
Brought problems to your world
And you said “how could you just lie to me? I thought you’d die for me?”
I was scared you’d find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to
You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to
And when Thanksgiving come around
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma
So it’s back to the drama
“No I don’t know that number”
“Why the hell you text it?”
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in
Young and living reckless
[Hook: Miguel & Big Sean]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you
Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you

[Outro: Miguel]
I can't imagine myself without you
I need a whole lot of help without you
Me and my granny both agreed
Damn you're such a G I’ll hold you down forever, B

[Hook: Miguel & Big Sean]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you
Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you175Embed

Jump Out the Window Lyrics[Chorus: Big Sean & Jeremih]
I think I’m ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I’m ready to jump out the window

[Verse 1]
Straight up, straight up, look
Know ya momma didn’t raise you to take no disrespect, yeah
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check, yeah
You cried on my phone the whole night
That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh I was there) I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
The question isn't, "Do he love ya?" The question is, "Do ya love yourself?"
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess way back then
We the best thing that never happened, but
[Chorus]
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

[Verse 2]
You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needin' clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

[Chorus]
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window
[Outro]
Look, I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth I gotta know
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
This one's for you, you, you, you, you, you, you45Embed

Living Single Lyrics[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back"
Fuck it
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby, we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I done have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24
I'm like why nigga, why?
You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
He like, "ahhh"
Fuck it, we about to do therapy
Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm carefree with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how when I'm with her I feel whole too
Go on, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he on target with everything I've been missing
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4 AM and out at 8 for work
And I'm the reason we ain't make it work
That's what makes it worse
Damn
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl21Embed

Voices In My Head / Stick to the Plan Lyrics[Part I: "Voices in My Head"]

[Chorus]
Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
(You know better, what the fuck!)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

[Verse]
This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me 'bout
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit
[Chorus]
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
(Yeah, you know what's about to go down)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck
(That's your problem, you don't listen!)

[Part II: "Stick to the Plan"]

[Intro]
Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 1]
Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracted
Put that into what's worth having (boy)
[Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 2]
Stay focused (stay focused)
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)
[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head46Embed
