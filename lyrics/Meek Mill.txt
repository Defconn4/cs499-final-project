Dreams and Nightmares (Intro) Lyrics[Intro]
Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
You ready? Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
And the matter of time I spent on some locked-up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!
Maybach Music
[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a minute (Minute), y'all thought I was finished? (Whoa)
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented? (Yeah)
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I’m the type to count a million cash then grind like I’m broke
That Lambo' my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (Skrrt)
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (Let's go)
We young niggas, we mobbin' (Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (Whoa)
This two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'
I'm like, "Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?"
If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up!
If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
Boy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on 12 o'clock (Rah)
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies
And when there’s beef, I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone
Woo!261Embed

R.I.C.O. Lyrics[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright
[Verse 1: Drake]
Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man, woo!
[Refrain: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly!
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (Switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh, listen, you hear that?
[Refrain: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

Going Bad Lyrics[Intro: Drake & Future]
Yeah
(Wheezy outta here)
Jeez, jeez

[Verse 1: Drake]
Back home, smokin' legal (Legal)
I got more slaps than The Beatles (Beatles)
Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg (Who you say you was?)
Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely (Strapped)
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me (What you gotta do?)
Bring the clip back empty (It's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (Sent me, dawg)
I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg (10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg
[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway (What?)
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade
Still goin' bad on you anyway

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
Woah, woah, ooh, woah
Woah, woah, ah

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris (80 racks)
Me and Drizzy back-to-back, it's gettin' scary (Back-to-back)
If you fuckin' with my opps, just don't come near me (Get outta my way)
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille cost a Lambo (That's a Lambo)
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando (Salute)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)
Ain't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go (That's a Fendi)
For real
She said, "Oh, you rich rich?" ("You rich rich")
Bitch, I graduated, call me "Big Fish" (Marlin)
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list (That's Lori)
That's the only thing I want for Christmas (True story, uh)
I've been had my way out here, yeah, know that's facts (Facts)
You ain't livin' that shit you say, yeah, we know that's cap (That's cap)
You ain't got to ask me when you see me, know I'm strapped (Brrt)
DC, OVO, we back again, we goin' plat' (Ooh, ooh)
[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

Wanna Know Lyrics[Produced by Jahlil Beats & Swizz Beatz]

[Intro]
I just wanna know how niggas going to jail
Telling on niggas, coming back home and it still being cool
I just wanna know how a nigga on Instagram and Twitter with fifty thousand followers
Ain’t got no money in real life, but still popping, I just wanna know
I wanna know, if a nigga ain’t really putting it in, but acting like he putting it in
Niggas still letting it fly like it’s cool, I really wanna know man
This shit getting different out here it’s getting spooky

[Verse 1: Meek Mill + Quentin Miller]
Now when that shit went down with Chris, you wrote a check
In New Orleans wore my chain to get respect (you a fraud)
So what that tell me? You a pussy and a fed
Say the wrong shit you know the shooters at your neck
I just wanna know, if you ain’t write that running through the six shit (huh)
Tell us who the fuck was Quentin running through the six with?
"Running through the six with my woes
Counting money, you know how it goes
All the real live forever, baby
And the fake get exposed"
Niggas writing for you 'cause you know you never did shit
When I threw that hook out, I was tryin' to catch a big fish
We the type of niggas to tie your mother up (Woah)
Fuck your sister in the ass and hit your brother up, pussy
You really sweet, I call you buttercup
You fucking dork you changed the style because you studied us
Coming with the same flow
Switching up your lingo
We just want a refund, this ain’t what we paid for
Every time that we come, we get what we came for
Spitting another niggas shit, but you claim you king though?
[Hook]
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
How these niggas acting like they trill but really fake
And people acting like it go
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Was it Quentin Miller? Was it Hush or was it Detail where you really got your flow?
(Milli Vanilli that nigga)

[Verse 2]
Money make a fake ass nigga look real again (For real)
Money make a sucker that told look trill again (For real)
Says a lot about all the people that's feeling him
But I'ma show you bitch ass niggas what's real again
Heard that other nigga talking we ain’t get back yet
Let’s keep it short, nigga you ain’t get your chick back yet
And now she rocking with the chaser and now you missed that check
You went from Clear Port to boarding pass you miss that jet, hold up

[Interlude 1: Sample]
"Cat, I got to take them off of here—that's right—I got to take them off of here, there’s only one, and that’s me, you understand?
'Fore all that fighting, you understand? Sucka thinks he good—sucka thinks he can whoop me, And I know he can’t whoop me and I—Hey, boy, the nigga whole style is chump, you understand? When it comes to me, you understand, let me get mines first. Then after I get mine, y’all can do what you wanna do."

[Verse 3]
You know you fucked up right? (Hey!)
You shoulda just said nothing
Now you're going to have to give me a check to stop
All I hear is platinum that platinum this
Meanwhile I’m on the carpet with a platinum chick
I got a platinum rollie, platinum whip
Niggas frauds I told the truth, don’t ask me shit
All this industry fake enemy and rap shit
It’s never really my style we got cash to get (Gettin' money)
I really started from nothing now it’s back to shit
Puffy almost caught a domestic when he smacked that bitch
Hold up, let that bitch breathe (Woah)
[Interlude 2: Diddy]
"Yeah, this is called poppin' shit. There’s no cut on it. There’s no cut on it. If your feelings get hurt, you feel like, "Oh, that’s an arrogant little comment—" no, this is the truth and the truth hurts. Haven’t I paid my dues? Haven't I weathered the storm? Didn’t I weather the storm? Niggas is gone and I'm here."

[Outro]
You let Tip homie piss on you in a movie theater nigga, we ain’t forget
Real niggas back in style this shit is lit
This that Ja Rule shit and 50 Cent253Embed

Amen Lyrics[Intro: Meek Mill & Drake]
I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin' me ball on these niggas (Yeah)
Ah

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)

She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)

Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'ma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill and (Jeremih)]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto, cause it's a lot of...

What’s Free Lyrics[Intro: Meek Mill]
You know what free is, nigga?

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free?
[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Since a lad, I was cunning, just got a pad out in London
I keep stackin' my money, I'll need a ladder by summer
AK shots, niggas duckin' stray shots
Been a top dog, that's before the K-Dots
Crackin' in '06, immaculate showmanship
Talkin' like you Mitch, disastrous on the strip
Holdin' on your bitch, coulda never sold you a brick
With them people, you never been on a list
Mona Lisa to me ain't nothin' but a bitch
Hangin' pictures like niggas swingin' from his dick
We so different, you thought these didn't exist (M-M)
The Megalodon never seen on his wrist
I'm from the South where they never make it this rich
God is the greatest, but Satan been on his shit
Walkin' the pavement, I pray I'm illuminated
Over a decade and never nobody's favorite
Pot and kilo go hand in hand like we Gamble and Huff
My amigo, a million grams and we countin' 'em up (M-M)
You was dead broke, I let you hold a pack
You paid for it, but I fucked around and stole the track
Screaming "gang gang," now you wanna rat
Racketeering charges caught him on a tap
Lookin' for a bond, lawyers wanna tax
Purple hair got them faggots on your back
(M-M-Maybach music)
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Fed investigations, heard they plottin' like I trap
20 mill' in cash, they know I got that off of rap
Maybe it's the Michael Rubins or the Robert Krafts
Or the billionaire from Marcy, and the way they got my back, uh
See how I prevailed now they try to knock me back, uh
Locked me in a cell for all them nights and I won't snap, uh
Two-fifty a show and they still think I'm sellin' crack, uh
When you bring my name up to the judge, just tell him facts
Tell him how we fundin' all these kids to go to college
Tell him how we ceasin' all these wars, stoppin' violence
Tryna fix the system and the way that they designed it
I think they want me silenced (Shush)
Oh, say you can see, I don't feel like I'm free
Locked down in my cell, shackled from ankle to feet
Judge bangin' that gavel, turned me to slave from a king
Another day in the bing, I gotta hang from a string
Just for poppin' a wheelie, my people march through the city
From a cell to a chopper, view from the top of the city
You can tell how we rockin', soon as I pop up we litty
Poppin' like Bad Boy in '94, Big Poppa and Diddy
And niggas counted me out like my accountant ain't busy
That's five milli' in twenties, sit up and count 'til I'm dizzy
Phantom 500 thousand, hundred round in a stizzy
Is we beefin' or rappin'? I might just pop up with Drizzy like
[Chorus: Meek Mill & JAY-Z]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true (Run it down)
Real life, what's free?

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
In the land of the free, where the blacks enslaved
Three-fifths of a man, I believe's the phrase
I'm 50% of D'USSÉ and it's debt free (Yeah)
100% of Ace of Spades, worth half a B (Uh)
Roc Nation, half of that, that's my piece
Hunnid percent of TIDAL to bust it up with my Gs, uh
'Cause most of my niggas won't ever work together
You run a check up but they never give you leverage
No red hat, don't Michael and Prince me and 'Ye
They separate you when you got Michael and Prince's DNA, uh
I ain't one of these house niggas you bought
My house like a resort, my house bigger than yours
My spou- (Come on, man)
My route better, of course
We started without food in our mouth
They gave us pork and pig intestines
Shit you discarded that we ingested, we made the project a wave
You came back, reinvested and gentrified it
Took niggas' sense of pride, now how that's free?
And them people stole the soul and hit niggas with 360s, huh
I ain't got a billion streams, got a billion dollars
Inflating numbers like we 'posed to be happy about this
We was praisin' Billboard, but we were young
Now I look at Billboard like, "Is you dumb?"
To this day, Grandma 'fraid what I might say
They gon' have to kill me, Grandmama, I'm not they slave
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, check out the bizarre (Ah)
Rappin' style used by me, the H-O-V
Look at my hair free, carefree, niggas ain't near free
Enjoy your chains, what's your employer name with the hairpiece?
I survived the hood, can't no Shaytan rob me
My accountant's so good, I'm practically livin' tax free
Factory, that's me
Sold drugs, got away scot-free
That's a CC, E-copy
Guilt free, still me
And expect me to not feel a way to this day
You would say y'all killed me
Sucker free, no shuckin' me, I don't jive turkey
Say "Happy Thanksgiving," shit sound like a murder to me
Smoke free, all of y'all callin' out toll free
Label rob you for millions yet you wanna put a hole in me
Sugar free, seasoned but I'm salt free
You lay a hand on Hov, my shooter shoot for free
I promise World War Three
Send a order through a hands free
Kill you in 24 hours or shorter, you can't ignore the hand speed
On god, it's off the head, this improv but it's no comedy
Sign I fail? Hell nah
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) Hahahahahahahahaha53Embed

Ooh Kill ’Em Lyrics[Skit: Maleek]
Get it right Terio
Ooh, ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh

[Intro: Meek Mill]
You ready? You ready?
I don't think they is
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move they lips
I spit crack for my niggas that be moving bricks
With they exclusive bitch
Sippin' on Amaretto when she loose and shit
Niggas sleeping on me then I Freddy Krueger shit
With a few Philly niggas that be shootin' shit
I'm like Dre, I wish I had my nigga Snupe for this
Oh, I grew up, I screw up a oz of crack
Then I blew up they knew us before all this rap
I maneuvered with shooters
You fuck around with me, get smoked like a hookah
My ruger go booyah, I do it for the streets
You do it for the nigga with the backpack
I do it for the niggas on the corner
Tryna make a meal ticket with a crack pack
Hold up wait a minute let me back track
Hov gave you 24, let you have that
Man you claiming you the king of New York
What the fuck wrong with you nigga, step back
Hundred shots, aim straight at your snap cap
Everybody want the crown so I snatch that
Heard your gun go doo-doo-dooo-dooo
Well my gun go blat-blat-blat-blat-blat
What the fuck I gotta whisper to niggas
To earn my respect just to get to these niggas
Go Ether, Takeover or Jigga on niggas
Or really go 2Pac and Biggie on niggas
What the fuck wrong with him
Like really I'm sick of you niggas
You've been in the game like a year and some change
And you feeling yourself so I'm killing these niggas like...
[Bridge: Meek Mill]
(H-h-h-hold up, wait)
Let the beat come back and the streets come back
Niggas on the west tryna make the east come back
Make me grow these nappy braids, make the beast come back like
(H-h-h-hold up, wait)
And a nigga fuck around get the R.I.C.O Act
Shoot shoot, and one, where my free throw at?
And my lil' nigga Bobby can't eat those flats
Like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
They know Meek Milly, I barely went gold
But Meek Milly look like he sold two million
All this new money I'm getting my nigga
I swear I don't know what to do with it
Yeah it's Meek Milly, I'm bombing on rappers
I really don't give a fuck who with 'em
Pair with a nigga like me one time, like me one time
And ya'll forgot about me
Acting like I don't really want mine
What the fuck wrong with em
Know how we feeling, let me get back to it
Terio like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh186Embed

Dangerous Lyrics[Intro]
Right Now Sound
Hitmaka!

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in your eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
No angel, but you got a halo
When it's nights like this
I really wanna be right here
I really wanna take you there (you there, oh there)
When it's nights like this
I really wanna be right here (be right here)
I really wanna take you there (you there, baby, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2: Meek Mill & Jeremih]
Uh, it was nights like this, feelin' right like this
I never really spent no time like this, huh
The second time at the crib knowin' I might not hit
You said, "What I look like?" Like my bitch, yeah
Look into your eyes, shit is dangerous
The pussy wet, I call it angel dust
I done put so many diamond chains on you, they get tangled up
I never felt like this, it's strange as fuck (that's what it's like loving you)
Got yo ex nigga calling, but he can't do much
'Cause you with the kid now, Ella Mai, boo'd up
And all you gotta do is call and watch that Wraith pull up
Under the stars since they throwin' all that shade on us
Facts, woo!

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous (Your eyes)
Grateful I had all the patience, hey

Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uh, you feel the vibe, uh, I'm deep inside, yeah
You fuckin' me, ooh, I let you ride, yeah
At first you curved me, I let you slide in
Yo hips so curvy, you let me slide in
Ooh, and it was over once I flipped you over
Relation goal when we come through just like Beyoncé, Hova
This that Hermes money, this ain't no Fashion Nova
You said yo ex had you depressed and I'm just glad that's over
'Cause now you rockin' with a real one
And when I'm in it, you be maxin' on a million
And when I hit it back to back, you make me still cum
I know them bitches hatin' on you, we gon' kill them
That's facts
[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous (Your eyes)

Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you

[Verse 4: PnB Rock & Jeremih]
Ayy, you know you bad babe
You know I laugh at these shawties that try to text back
You from the projects, but so exotic
Just give me all of that pussy, so many options (so many options)
Girl, you got me callin', all these different numbers
Why you being selfish? You know that I want you
You be leavin' work and you deserve a Birkin
Girl, you so contagious, damn that shit so dangerous

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious

Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for

Litty Lyrics[Intro]
Sound M.O.B

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Woo!
I'm on my way to an island and I'm poppin' shit at the pilot (Fly shit only)
Niggas be broke and be starvin' but still talkin' shit like they violent (Niggas is broke!)
They said that they honest, talk money, these niggas gon' say that they got it (Huh?)
Gettin' out with the key to success and these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't wanna see you win (They don't!)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (No!)
You don't wanna see your bitch caught up in the stars like she outer space
Mansion at the condo, condo at the mansion, and I'm runnin' out of space
Tell your homie, keep on comin' out his mouth, I'm sendin' somethin' 'round his way (Brrt)
Niggas barely getting lawyer money (Woo)
Better get some Sig Sauer money
Running 'round like you Superman, don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (Ha!)
Woo, 'cause I'm the one to put it on your money
I'm the one that make it happen it to you niggas, would you fuck around and do it for me?
[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Feature money out the safe, went and brought a Wraith, brought it down Collins
Niggas talkin' like they want it, when we in the city, they don't want problems
Niggas said they gon' rob us
But nigga, we comin' from welfare
I shoot a mullet when I pull it, how you catch a bullet like a NFL player?
Should've known it was litty when bitches start lyin' on my dick
Lie on that pussy like I hit
Can't even be a side, side bitch
I'm hittin' 9s, 10s, and you ain't even looking like you a 5
Broke bitches tryna do it for Twitter, when they used to do it for Vine, woah!
I'm the man of the hour, I'm the nigga with the airtime
Rolls Royce Wraith, put your bitch up in the stars like she in the airline
Niggas talkin' 'bout my hair line, I laugh about it, I be feelin' them
See, we both be making M's: they be makin' memes, I be makin' millions
I just counted up a Quentin Miller
A "QM", that's a quarter milli
They don't wanna see Jae drop "6," fly private when he go to Philly
Funny money, yeah I know it's silly, but your ho feel me
When I pull up and I got a pour a whole four on it
I promise she gon' know it's litty, motherfucker, yeah
[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
All of my niggas is way up
These niggas is haters, I know that they haters (Suckers)
I score your bitch like a layup (Score)
I make a mil' like a layup (More)
I pop a pill just to stay up (Woo)
I sip the lean just to slow it up (Slow it up)
I'm with my team, and we goin' up (Goin' up)
All of these foreigns, they know it's us (Ah!)
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Like the coca when we mix the soda up (Whip it)
Perfect timin' and we're blowin' up (Blowin' up)
Fuck it, I'ma light the Rollie up (Rollie up)
Shorty fuckin' for Chanel!
I ain't trippin', that's a coconut (Coconut)
Push the 'Rari 'til the motor bust
Stack the paper, fill the sofa up (Woo)
Lay on that paper, I am not slackin', I stay on that paper
I feel like it's a restraining order on that money, 'cause y'all stay away from that paper
I know some niggas that used to be ballin', but know they all feeling a way 'bout this paper
I be spending hundred, hundred, hundred after hundred
They thought I was makin' this paper!
Fuckin' it good, I be rapin' this paper
Shit, I might as well get married to money
I marry Nicki, still married to money
She rich as Mariah, I carry the money
And fuck a deposit, I bury the money (Bury them M's)
I bag the money, it hang out my pocket, embarrassin' money
I act like I ain't used to havin' this money, oh!
[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad
They don't wanna see the Wraith
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again61Embed

God (Yeah)
Oh God, boi (Yeah)
G.O.O.D. (MMG, nigga)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill & Big Sean]
Chain all V.S. I ain't with the B.S
Catch me in your city riding hard through the B-X
Skinny nigga but I do it large like a 3X
The last nigga tried to do me wrong, umm, he checked
Right back to that money slinging O's in the p-jects (Yeah)
Or probably catchin' mileage while the pilot steer the P-Jet
(Woah) Cause we next and we flex like...

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
90PX (Woah), working all night no breaks or a recess
Vroom vroom yeah I know my car sound like a T-Rex
Bitch, I'm 23 years old and I ain't riding in a Prius (Swerve)
My cousin finished school can't believe he graduated (Boi)
Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations (Ah)
Cause me? I wasn't made for that shit
But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that was dissin' I pray to God that you see me
I'm on a yacht getting hella' high smoking good that seaweed
Bad bitch in her cha-cha grabbing on her chi-chi's
Million dollar deals on my email you mad as hell you ain't CC'ed
Chain all V.S., bitch, you know it's B.S
Boy, I run my city
[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
End of story, nigga P.S.
All white Maybach, Green Bay they packing
Y'all niggas was slackin', 'member the hard nights we trappin'
And they say life's a game of chess
You can play checkers all on my jacket
Cause it's Damier and we bombs away on y'all bitch rappers
I say yeah, nigga, I murder that, Panamera turtle back
Niggas say they want beef, well, where the fuck is my burger at?
I got white, was serving that, I been to jail, I ain't going back
I alley-oop your bitch off that backboard, she throw it back
I slam dunk in that pussy, Blake Griffin'd your ho, nigga
Maybach with Ricky Ross my chain rock like I know Jigga
That's cause I do, ho, shout out to my new ho
That pussy pink like Nuvo and I dog that; Cujo

[Chorus: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Niggas wanna talk, what they gon' say? (gon' say)
I hit the pedal til that motherfucker break (til it break)
Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn! Let that shit burn
I'ma let that shit burn, let that shit burn (Burn, gasoline!)
The roof on fire, I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket, I want bottles, I'ma let that shit burn
[Verse 4: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Bitch, I had one shot and I ain't blow it
Riding til the wheels fall off and they tow it
I got green on top of green damn it's looking like I grow it
D-Town the hood behind me like a king cobra
Burn bitch, I let it burn bitch
My money straighter than a motherfucking perm, bitch
No navigation you can see it is my turn shit (swerve, swerve)
Shorty give me all that brain still ain't never learned shit

[Verse 5: Big Sean]
Oh that's your girl? Damn nigga, you ain't learn shit
She naked in my studio I'm on that Howard Stern shit
I swear that mac 10 is my barbell, Finally Famous the cartel
Hit your girl in my whip and now that pussy got the new car smell
Same shit, different day, I ain't broke no more, it's a different day
Don't turn me down, I got shit to say
My purp strong like it's lifting weights

I got a bad bitch with them pom pom's
My Rollie don't tick-tock, your shit sound like a time bomb
Boom! Lil' bitch

[Chorus: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Niggas wanna talk, what they gon' say? (gon' say)

Lord Knows Lyrics[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like fifty bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking risky business, flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm fifty-six
They say I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
To spit my new verse at your wake while you're lying
The middle of the church have you wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crying
They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and I roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble, I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called you collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game, Philly as shit
Look at these rappers, they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose, came up from nothing
And now they like, "How he made millions so quick?"
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca, no way
[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, niggas can't see me with binoculars on
Back of the Maybach, shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me, that's a chopper zone
Every time you be on count, what the topic on?
Two hundred and fifty thou' what I dropped it on
See y'all think it's a game 'til FOX be on
CNN, momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything, got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Stick and moving on these niggas, get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas is what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler, that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Ya'll looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real
Don't give a fuck if its eighty mill', pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley won't make you thorough, pussy
Still hating me from my city
I'm thinking is they for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
They'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money
Don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city
I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it, you pussy
[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?

1942 Flows Lyrics[Verse 1]
Started off poor with plans to own more
Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores
I was on tour with niggas that sold raw
Started sellin' white, we won't sell it no more
I'm like, Trump ain't feelin' us, cops still killin' us
Niggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough
Cut her off, act like she's dead and it's killin' her
New Dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling up
Just to kill 'em softly, ooh, get 'em off me
Try to crucify me like I'm Jesus the way she cross me
I'm too bossy and too thorough
To move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow
We started off with zero, now I'm seein' M's
Diamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym
Shootin' like Harden if your head was the rim
'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn
Back when I was broke, they was cool with it
Now every move I make I'm in the news with it
Even if I ain't do it they be like "You did it!"
My teacher always used to tell me "You gon' lose nigga!"
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Billy with the stamp, I get two with it
Move with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me every time I pray at night
Scoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life
And make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
Reachin' for the Glock every time I play the light
I'm on 12 o'clock every time I play them bikes
I'm with the pack, uh, gettin' back, yeah
Spendin' dope, nigga, sellin' smack, gang
I'm gettin' chips off music like Rap Snacks
Yeah, 10 mil in cash of Ethika, that's a fact
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet
I know these niggas upset, they ain't see me fall yet
Wins and losses!
[Chorus]
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Verse 2]
Bloggers in a frenzy, truck to the Bentley
Ain't doin' no interviews, I'm busy, nigga we litty
So when you see me out don't ask me about no Nicki
Fuck I look like tellin' my business on Wendy
Niggas gossip like queens, we was servin' fiends
.40 bust your windows out: Jazmine Sullivan
They told 'em pop Mollys, I told 'em to be kings
Sippin' 1942 like it's lean
I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
So I'ma give it to 'em every time I'm on the scene
Pull up Ghost Ghost, Wraith Wraith when you see me
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it, I go through it, don't show it
I told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast
Like Ramadan, totin' K's like it's Palestine
Real niggas in my ambiance, bottom line
Ever since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
I gave my momma 10,000 at least a thousand times
Do the math on it!
[Chorus]
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Verse 3]
Talkin', this my cocky flow
Damn Daniel, why you son him? Mr Miyagi though
This that rose gold Patek, call me like '94
Mean nothin' to me, I tell you how it gotta go
Rain, sleet, on that corner when the block was slow
Everybody was tryna trap, we started poppin' though
Heard that bitch say she cut me, I was like "¡adiós!"
In the field, knock 'em down, it look like dominoes
Young nigga, I turned my Impala to a Wraith
When you get a dollar they gon' hate
Bought my mom the crib with that gate
Private school for all them babies, now they straight, nigga

[Chorus]
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us30Embed

Levels Lyrics[Intro]
See, it's brackets, nigga
Them hoes ain't fuckin' you
'Cause you ain't in that bracket, nigga
Learn life, it's levels to this shit, young boy
Ayy, O, you feel me?

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!
[Verse 1]
'Cause it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Can't fuck my ho, 'cause it's levels to this bitch
And I be rockin' Prada like a devil in this bitch
And a Birkin bag like a gold medal to this bitch
And I'm heavy as it get
Shinin' like a motherfuckin' bezel on my wrist
All my niggas mobbin' so we heavy in this bitch
Thirty grand for the Muller, that's a Chevy on my wrist
Woo! Cocaine Mulsanne
Young nigga blowin' up; Kurt Cobain—boom!
Skatin' on them like I'm Lil Wayne
And this 458 don't do the lil' lane—vroom!
Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em
'Cause I heard the feds got him and he had them birds on him
But a nigga back home and now niggas roll with him
Caught a case, what you think? Nigga fuckin' told on him
I ain't get my shit snatched yet
You ain't get your bitch back yet
One call, niggas aim that TEC
Blood drawn, headshot, nigga brains on step
Hot shit if you pop shit
And I don't want your opinion if you ain't got shit
We young niggas, we winnin', I pull up, drop shit
Mob shit, with more keys than a locksmith
[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!

[Verse 2]
Damn, Tommy, you ain't got no job!
DC, we the motherfuckin' mob
Young nigga gettin' straight to the money
In a Range with your honey, I pull up, like, "Ahh!"
I make them power moves with Jay and them
Them boys shootin', don't play with them
Maybach, Rozay and them
Rollin' down Collins, call Rugs, hit the A with them
Compound niggas live now
If it's the finals I'm ballin' like I'm LeBron now
I call up Onyx and tell them bitches to calm down
I treat the jet like a taxi the way I'm flyin' round
And I don't fuck with no niggas
If they don't fuck with my niggas
And I ain't fuckin' no bitches, if they fuckin' my niggas
[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!

[Verse 3]
One time for the real niggas
Two times for the bad bitches
Y'all suckas be cuffin' hoes
'Cause y'all suckas never had bitches
I hit the dealer, bought another Rolls
That's the reason why you mad, nigga?
That's the reason why you hatin' on me?
I love ballin'—my bad, nigga
'Cause it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Can't fuck my ho, 'cause it's levels to this bitch
'Cause it's levels to this bitch
And a Birkin bag like a gold medal to this bitch
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, hold up!

Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit

Bad for You Lyrics[Produced by Ben Billions]

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
And they say bad girls ain't no good
Good girls ain't no fun
I still can't find a nigga that touch that
I don't know one
And I ain't searching for it
Never trust but I'm working on it
Fell in love with that ride game
Swimming pool, you surfing on it
Like 'Yonce, do the surfboard, surfboard
They still think you a church girl
We linking up on your days off
And I still give you that work girl
Like work, twerk
Do it like that video
Wanted that for a long time
Cool with it, I get it though
First year we both fronted
We had feelings we didn't show
Second year we couldn't hide it
Funny part they didn't know
How could something that's so wrong feel so right?
But who to tell you this wrong, though? This your life
Word up
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
We just fucking up the city, going hard every night
Niggas hating on us, you know lord they ain't right
Cause I broke a lot of hearts, ain't do them girls right
But you broke hearts too, but that boy ain't fight
So they don't deserve it, it feel like it's perfect
I'm loving your style the way you preserve it
Just look at my eyes and see what's inside
You know that it's pride, you say that I'm worth it
But said I ain't ready, really I'm ready
Really I'm ready, I'm ready like never before
I'mma just give you a key to my heart
You'll be the first that I let in the door
I used to hear that you flirt with them guys
They never would score
All you was hearing about me and the women
Ain't trust them before
You know what you're doing, fuck what they said
You know what we on
When we in bed, it's like we on stage
And I got the mic so let me perform, sing it
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad95Embed

Heaven Or Hell Lyrics[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ayo, this the one? We all get caught in our own sins. Sometimes I have to remind myself, that on my worst day, I live like somebody on their greatest—and so do you. Don't let your demons take you to Hell. Introduce 'em to Heaven!

[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look, I got homies in the ground, skeleton and bones
And niggas doin' life, they ain't never comin' home
They said I wouldn't make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me ‘cause she said I did her wrong
‘Cause I left, to chase my dream, get it any means
I said that I'll be back, she wasn't listenin' to me
That back-and-forth arguin' was gettin' in between
I said fuck them other niggas, I go get it with my team
If we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part-time
I used to play the block early mornin' and dark time
Now it's G5 flights, fuck a depart time
It was hard times, nigga, now it's our time
Just take a look at my life, rappin' brought me back to life
‘Cause I was in them streets, my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strappin' like we was in Iraq to fight
‘Cause niggas gettin' murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Whoa, I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boilin' water, in the world of no order
In the hood, ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
Ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
I'ma get the fam right, nigga, you damn right!
[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I used to pop a lot of shit, now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out, hoppin' outta shit
Right now I'm prayin' for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university, one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go, I acknowledge it
But whoever ain't a snake's usually a follower
Luckily, I can tell the difference
My man comin' home, my other man gettin' sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hatin' on your pictures
We dream-chasin', y'all niggas walkin' behind wishes
Without workin' for it, not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins, others just find ditches
Just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothin' all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a headshot, some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the Devil, he's see-through
[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life74Embed

Look, I be ridin' through my old hood, but I'm in my new whip (Yes sir)
Same old attitude, but I'm on that new shit (Yeah)
They say they gon' rob me, see me, never do shit (Never)
'Cause they know that's the reason they gon' end up on a news clip (Murder)
Audemar on my wrist, bust down (Bling)
We poppin' bottles like I scored the winnin' touchdown (Score)
'Member me dead broke? (Broke) Look at me up now (Up)
I run my city from South Philly back to Uptown
Thank God, all these bottles I popped
All this paper I been gettin', all these models I popped
I done sold a hundred thousand 'fore my album got dropped
And I'm only 23, I'm the shit, now, look at me
Look at me, I'm a boss like my nigga Rozay
Shorty asked me for a check, I told that bitch like no way (No way)
'Cause I made it from the bottom, it was never no way
And I never had a job, you know I had to sell yay
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss) I call the shots (Call the shots)

Got so many shades, they thought I had a lazy eye (Huh)
Shorty rode me smooth as my Mercedes ride (Huh)
No love, cry when only babies die
And when I go, that casket better cost a hundred thou'
I pray to God I look my killer in his eyes
Snatch his soul out his shirt, let's take him for that ride (For that ride)
OG is one who standin' on his own feet
A boss is one who guarantee we gon' eat (Huh)
Fuck a blog, dawg, 'cause one day we gon' meet (Gon' meet)
I'ma spaz on yo ass like I'm Monique
Or a double stack, bet a nigga double that
Jerry Jones money, nigga, you a running back (You a running back)

Blue Notes Lyrics[Intro: Snowy White]
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes, it's a fine old thing
When the night is cold and low
(This is a Dollar Bill beat)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Was it the money that made me a savage?
Poppin' them Percs and I made it a habit
Totin' them pistols and serving them addicts
That was exciting to me, I'm so excited to be
Started with nothin', we had to inspire to be
Niggas ain't flyer than me, I'm getting to it
Feel like the man, I got the plan
I call the shooters, they hop out the van
Play with the squad, get popped like a Xan
Pop like a Perc, I'm goin' ham
I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie
Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty
Then straight to the jeweler, I'm bustin a Rollie
To light up the city like Meechie in '03
I got the plug, he send 'em OT
Don't know these niggas, these niggas know me
Even old niggas, they call me OG
Young nigga but I put it down
We was on it when it weren't 'round
All of sudden niggas wanna come around
Stay over there, my G
[Interlude: Meek Mill & Snowy White]
This is my blues
Do me one favor, take a few steps back
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
And look at yourself
Matter fact, take yourself outside your body
And then look at yourself
And see how you playing yourself, nigga
This is the blues I'm playing
Congratulations, it's the motherfuckin' Chasers
Yes, it's a fine old thing
You feel me? We on it
When the night is cold and low

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Gave you the plug
Try to be real with some niggas and put 'em on money
And show 'em some love
You did me a favor, I knew you was sheisty
I knew you would show who you was
It's only a matter of time before niggas get lined
And hit with them slugs
Get found in a pool of your blood, yeah, nigga
'Member they told me that we would fail
'Member they said we would see a cell
Down with that semi like Cam Newton
I'm in the field like the NFL
Niggas is sick' and I wish em well
I made a wish in a wishing well
I put a brick in a wishing well
Been through some shit and I'm sick of jail
No disease but I'm sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending niggas mail
Calling niggas just to get a bail
I just seen a nigga get a L
Never coming homeand minute on the phone
Sick and tired of seeing niggas fail
Sick and tired of seeing niggas lose
Sinning like we tryna get to hell
[Outro: Snowy White]
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes, it's a final thing
When the night is cold and low25Embed

War Pain Lyrics[Produced by Ben Billions]

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Location: Toronto; Status: five star hotel, Four Seasons. Them chumps right upstairs, they know not to come down here playin' no real niggas. Mood: I'm still up countin' five hundred thousand cash. Nicki in the bedroom sleep, life is good

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I've been in my cell for a week straight
Locked down 24, no more Philip's Steak
Damn, shit's so real it seems fake
Damn, let me take 'em to the green gate
When we was sellin' white girl
Audemar shinin' like it need a light bill
These niggas dick ride like they don't even like girls
A hundred thousand for the jet, yeah that's the flight bill
Damn, cost four bricks to go to the LIV nigga
Whole squad on some shit, that's how we live nigga
Twenty-five bad bitches what we did nigga
That's fifty different Louboutins bleedin' red nigga
Whew, I ain't blood and I ain't crippin' neither
On the phone with the plug talkin' Justin Bieber
I made a milly last week and I ain't touch it neither
Straight cash tryna give 'em straight gas
Catch you out in Brooklyn, get your chain tookin'
My Philly boys'll creep up on you when you ain't lookin'
With your lil memes, I be with the real queen
Screamin' free the real Preme, we be doin' real things
Pull up with a bad bitch, whippin' somethin' real mean
Marchin' all these fuckin' drums on me like a drill team
I be with my young niggas, all they know is kill things
Don't make me make a real scene, uh
See an OVO chain, probably take that shit
Said dreamin' wasn't enough, we had to chase that shit
You ain't write it' nigga, we caught ya, can't erase that shit
And you claimin' you HOV now? Why you state that shit?
Man I hate that shit, niggas be talkin' out they face
But soon as you body somethin' they be singin' like they Drake
Wait, niggas dancin' like they fruitcakes
Hotline Bling don't get no bing up in this new Wraith
Pull up on the plug, swap that bag with the suitcase
DC4 on the way, that's nigga's due date
Robbed you in your city and you told
Tory from the 6, you hatin' on him, Lord knows
Culture vulture, now it's time to pay the tolls
Soft as the lacrosse team, boy that's word to HOV
No reply, word to God I'm on the floor still
Me and Nicki watchin' the Sixers, I'm closin' more deals
Dreamchasers' double MG, we got the door sealed
Roc Nation, Atlantic Records, I'm on my fourth deal
When I met you, you was on my dick
Asked me to hold the DC chain, now you on some shit
Omelly told me get it back cause he's like "boy's a bitch"
And I'm like, let him get it took cause we gon' charge 'em trips
[Interlude: Meek Mill & Omelly]
Fuckboy, huh charge you triple the way this real nigga stamp. Chasers, ahh. Location: Philly; Mood: Glock with 30; Status: triple OG, never been disrespected without retaliation, chump

[Verse 2: Omelly & Meek Mill]
I've been in the hood for like a year straight
Sippin' dirty, it be hard for me to stand straight
Damn, it's time to cut the dead weight
I'm tryna turn my CLS into a red Wraith
When I was sellin' hard crack you was scared straight
I dropped 9 and bought the Rollie with the red face
Meek the one that got the mil, the one that got the deal
I'm still lampin' with the shooters and they poppin' pills
These niggas like to rap diss they get popped for real
It's time to son these pussy rappers, I'm their pop for real
I'm the type to fuck your mom cause she's a thot for real
And I ain't got one, my pump playin' shotgun
Quarterback that Glock, Cam Newton, and you catch a hot one
And for the fam I'll keep shootin' until the cops come
Reload, double back, hold up cuz, I got one
Official only respect official and you are not one
No, we are not them, we be on some other shit
Deep in them trenches, duckin' narcotics and the government
Tracin' the dollar, flippin' that product, tryna double shit
Chewing like it's double mint
Man, who you niggas fuckin' with?
[Outro: Omelly]
Hah, hey Meek Mill man, I'ma start running down on these niggas too. Real rap, these niggas soft and they frauds, check DC record nigga, we flawless. Any nigga stepped up to the fuckin' plate got rolled over. I ain't just talkin' to be talkin', nigga, check the resume. How many times we got to fuck the city up for you niggas to pay homage. Fuck you niggas talking bout nigga? Slide through 20 deep, I'm talkin' bout 7 Rolls Royces, 3 Maybachs, 20 Rollies, 30 Cubans, 25 bad bitches, 25 Chanel bags, 6 Caddie trucks, jumbo jets.
