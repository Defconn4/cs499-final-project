Everybody rock with me because I'm up now

Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got them rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot

Hit your girl, that's check-free
She ain't used to text me
Now she wanna caress me
She keep tryna neck me
I gotta tell my bestie
Someone call my bestie
Think I found my bestie
Link up, make a check bleed
You know that I'm smokin' dope, I'll be high 'til next week
Know I had to let her go 'cause she can't arrest me

Move it out of town and Tommy Cruise the mission (Yeah)
Converse with my addictions, don't talk, I just listen (Just listen)
Five drugs that I'm mixin', money only thing on my vision
Infatuated with them semis and 'matics
All of my niggas is thugs with some habits (Habits)

Donâ€™t trust that nigga cause he gon' squeal (Nah)
Not buyin' shit if the pack not sealed (Don't want it)
I'm faded, Iâ€™m faded, off Xannies I'm wasted
My bitches they nasty, they suck it and taste it (Suck)
I'm short on my patience, I'm servin' my patient
I'm very impatient, lil' bitch come get naked
Pack comin' in but I donâ€™t need to weigh it
Chopper en route, I shoot once and shit sprayin' (Pew-pew-pew)
Canâ€™t come in my trap, the front door is gated
My prices inflated, my plug name is David
Drippin' through the city got a little bitch in Babee'Os
Fucked me on the spot 'cause she heard me on the radio
Three bitches, one of me, that's a perfect ratio
Donâ€™t wanna fuck the ho, I just want fellatio (Ah)
Let her play with the nut, put it in her bootyhole
Pop a couple pills and I beat it like a stereo (Ah)
Stuffed cup, Backwoods, ridin' 'round, merry-go
Cup need a oil change, Actavis I love to pour (Drank)
Hit a stain, hoggin' lanes, grippin' grain, gettin' throwed (808 Mafia)
Leave you brains in the grain, you another John Doe
No holds barred, when you see me I'ma let it go
No more 'gars so we rollin' up the fronto (Fo, fo, fo, fo, fo)
No more 'gars 'cause we rollin' out the fronto

My partner's got wops and it's probably a Glock or a Tommy
From H to the E double hockey sticks
Keep a choppa, chop you if you try me, bitch
Let's see who next on my homi' list
Carti like, "Rocky, you bodied this"
That's my prerogative
Shit on them, that's on my potty list
Accused of being bougie by a snobby bitch
Cops want to ID us
Hope they as fast as my Adidas
She say I'm special, that's obvious
Rich 'cause my ideas
Run up the racks
"For the most part I rap," when they ask what my hobby is
Run it up, not one of them
Rich as fuck, I'm a hundred up
Swipe, swipe, like I'm on a bus

Go2DaMoon Lyrics[Intro: Kanye West]
Do it...
Watch it...
Do it how I...
Watch it...
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She ugly hot, like a chick that call you to borrow
Five hunnid, then promise she gon' pay you back tomorrow
Then left with a scammer with a Gucci hat from Marshalls
Slept with him, then woke up, saw his watch was a Fossil
Everybody wear a costume, spray a little extra perfume
YEEZYs in the stock room, that's the name, make the stock boom
Hit the club with at least ten, you in a 500, that's a cheap Benz
I promised Playboi we'd get the tape out 'fore the weekend is over
Too famous to sneak in
Wolverine in a sheep skin, I be goin' off the deep end
We here for a reason, boy, we got more to do
You text just like, "Yo," I'm like, "Yo, I been avoidin' you"
Ye Jesus gang, you correct
You always askin' for Buddha, you a Budapest (Ayy)
If they don't play this, call the DJ
This verse just shut down the freeway
Born in the A, you can't impeach Ye
The case so brief, don't bring your briefcase
