[Verse 2: Drake]
Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju-, okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then ma'fucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin', I'm beast

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley, now
Vacay'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali (Mmm)
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Mmm)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Mmm)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow (Mmm) Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holler back, I'll do ya, beast
[Chorus: 2 Chainz, Drake, 2 Chainz & Drake]

1Train Lyrics[Produced by HitBoy]
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed, then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P., I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real
[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham
[Verse 7: Big K.R.I.T.]
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist380Embed

Goldie Lyrics[Chorus]
Aha, aha
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 1]
Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass
[Chorus]
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, “Tell it to my face”
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass
[Chorus]
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, oh, right
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off (Right, right)303Embed

Praise the Lord (Da Shine) Lyrics[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but never hurting numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
It's time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer
[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (Yeah)
I listened to X, I peeped the bars (Yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The game's a trap, protect your heart (Yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Skepta]
Uh, she came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans, my braids, my mans, my babes
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours289Embed

Peso Lyrics[Produced by A$AP Ty Beats]

[Verse 1]
I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your President
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing
'Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing
[Chorus]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos (Pesos)
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo, your bitch just said I'm hot, man, I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe
Inhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills
Import, export, Harlem catching rec still
So mami, show me how that neck feel (Feel)
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

[Chorus]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos

Wild for the Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wake up feeling blessed up, pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup, till I'm messed up, like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimpin' hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
I'm going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

[Verse 2]
Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feelin' like 'Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop, boy
Drunk as fuck, and I'm ready to fight
Wilding for the night, fuck being polite, boy

Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

[Verse 3]
It's the weekend and I'm creeping with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, callin' women bitches

Meet us in the cut and we can do the business

And your girl just said they with us

Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids-es

Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams, leave a punk nigga dreamin'

And you know them smokin' bitches rolling reefer got me open

Everyday Lyrics[Chorus: Rod Stewart & Miguel]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holler if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions
[Chorus: Rod Stewart & Miguel]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
"Hood dudes usually don't look like you"
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch
[Bridge: Miguel]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

[Chorus: Miguel & Rod Stewart]
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

L$D Lyrics[Verse]
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams
[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all

[Outro]
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD763Embed

Long Live A$AP Lyrics[Verse 1]
I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching, fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding, hide your kittens, hit your childrens with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hardheaded, never listen
Purp-purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians (Uh)
The land of no religion (Uh)
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my Benjis and my Bentley
And them bitches now I gets-gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me
[Chorus]
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live

[Verse 2]
Riding through your city like that motherfucker mine
Or toting on that semi, rob a motherfucker blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind?
Niggas talking down
Never talk to cops
Make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back, I'm talking 'bout your mom (Uh)
Cause there's killers in my town (Uh)
Making hits, sniffing lines (Yeah)
Out committing crimes (Yeah)
Wait for shit to simmer down (Uh)
Corrupted little minds (Yeah)
8 and 9, finna shine (Yeah)
On the grind
Do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya (Uh)
Where they shoot without a purpose
Services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it
Can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous
Who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?
[Chorus]
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live

[Bridge]
Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch know we poppin' so she poppin' on this dick
Nigga, RIP to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & KUČKA]
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever

[Verse 1]
Who the jiggy nigga with the gold links?
Got me reminiscin' 'bout my old day
Three 6, suck a nigga dick, no foreplay, all day
Boomin' out the trap through the hallway
Tell me, what you niggas know about it?
Auntie sayin' turn it down, or she finna call the cops
We be plottin' on the opps, she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A, and it's okay
They gon' take me back to my old ways
I was tryna chill, poppin' seals ever since I got a deal
Kick it with my model chick, sip Cris', fuck niggas wanna diss
Now I gotta let 'em know who's really trill
[Chorus]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Dirty fuck niggas, how you been?
You been crossin' our minds
Niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave 'em style nine times out of ten?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye

[Verse 2]
I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' with they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand-up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now
Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him
[Chorus]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Dirty fuck niggas, how you been?
You been crossin' our minds
Niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave 'em style nine times out of ten?

Multiply Lyrics[Produced by Curtis Heron]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply
Fuck niggas won't multiply, fuck niggas won't multiply
Igh, igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
[Interlude 1: Juicy J]
Yeah nigga, it's your boy Juicy J. Man, you gotta watch out for these old backstabbin', broke ass, you know what I'm sayin', jealous hatin' ass niggas out here man, you know what I'm sayin', man these niggas ain't no real niggas man, know what I'm sayin'? Man these niggas be smilin' in your face
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Back in the buildin', sold crack in the livin' room
Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a livin'
Doo rag, keep a red or blue flag in the denim
One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers don't sleep, take cat naps
Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad back, back back
Even in my will, keep it real, thuggin' in my field
'Til the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel
Youngins trained to kill, aimin', bangin' steel and slangin' krill
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill
Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose
I remember, if Pimp was alive he'd tell these hoes and these niggas
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I...
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When all the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
But if the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply

[Interlude 2: A$AP Rocky]
I'm the original Balmain badass, nigga
I'm the original Margiela madman, in the words of A$AP Yams
Smack the shit out a nigga in these skinny pants, feel me?
Don't get it fucked up, nigga, we been jiggy, been pretty
Still tell a bitch suck my dick, swag swag nigga

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
Shit, I might fuck around and bring the Jeep back
No doors on it, flexin' with the seat back
B-Boy with the G pack, might fuck around and bring the mink back
Word to Big Boi and 3 Stacks, nigga
If you deaf bring the beat back, nigga
Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
I'm a trendsetter, you ain't even peep that
Where the hoes, where the weed, where the cheese at?
Fuck the FCC, tell 'em bleep that
(We ain't no fashion killas nigga, we fashionable killas
Y'all got Flacko fucked up)
[Video Beat Switch]
[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I'm the motherfuckin' Lord of this fashion shit
Don't I deserve just to brag a bit?
Set the blueprint, fuck your two cents
Number 1 stunner, ask Tumblr if I'm accurate
My motherfuckin' swag is immaculate
Plus I got enough style just to mack your bitch
I think back to when pockets packin' lint
It's like a nigga got rich on accident
Now back to Pimp, bitches lie, killers never lie
Triggers on the side by side, bet I'm down to ride
Prosper said let's ride to the sky, call it catastrophic
We don't ever die, we just multiply, bitch

[Outro: Juicy J]
Fake ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin'? These niggas be out here talkin' 'bout they a street nigga and shit, man niggas be gettin' extorted like a mothafucka out here man, you know what I'm sayin'?648Embed

Phoenix Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck Illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptized in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks
[Verse 2]
Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile, you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas

[Bridge]
If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck

[Outro]
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan193Embed

Canal St. Lyrics[Produced by Hector Delgado, Frans Mernick, and A$AP Rocky]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, live through the strugglin', life's a every day (Hustle)
I hustle every day in life, thinkin' back
Takin' packs up the block, them older niggas said I couldn't (hustle)
Man fuck 'em niggas, I'll be back, strapped backpack
Bitch, I'm flippin' work, hand in hand, I think they call it track (hustle)
Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
Face the fact, there's always niggas out there, tryin' to knock the (hustle)
I guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin'
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff
Of my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, and's​ or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spent on Goyard
Used 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say (uhh)
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're stickin' to the script
My life is like a movie, they should film me through it
Take a pic, be sure to frame the shit, forever me, was always G
Way before this famous shit, y'all just pretend to do it
[Chorus: BONES]
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Rap game like the crack game, swear it's all the same (hustle)
Whippin' soda through the pot, watch it bubble
Flexin' muscle, hit the block, I bet I teach you niggas how to (hustle)
Sellin' coca on the charts, watch it double
Uh, takin' meetings on my bus, this shit my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous
Your favorite rappers' corpses couldn't measure my importance
My mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements
Heard the people want that raw shit, but y'all be talkin' bullshit
[Chorus: BONES]
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play

A$AP Forever Lyrics[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Gang! Gang! Gang!
They talkin' down on my name, don't let 'em run off with the name
Man I just run with the gang, A$AP boys came with the flame
Gang! Gang! They talkin' down on the gang
They wanna rep with the name but this ain't no regular name
Gang! Gang! They tryna run with the name
I might pull up with 3K but I do not fuck with no Klans

[Chorus]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexin' the same
I'm done with adjustin' to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
It's time to fuck up the whole game!
[Verse]
Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, "Cover your eyes
Cause smokin' with me, you go blind"
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose
[Pre-Chorus]
I put A$AP on my tat
I put New York on the map
I put the gang on the flames
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains
I got Goyard by the sack
I got the boof by the pack
I fucked your boo on her back

[Chorus]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
It's time to fuck up the whole game! (Game, game, game, game)

Gang, gang
They tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name
True to truth somehow (Gang, gang)
But never truly lied at all, then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang, A$AP boys come with the flame
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now

True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
In my dreams, I'm dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all, then and now
I never meant to hurt you (then and now)
I never meant to lie133Embed

Excuse Me Lyrics[Intro]
For all them hoes that was frontin' on niggas back in the days, man
(You know I'm sayin'? This for my broke jiggy niggas right now, you know)
Excuse me, fuck out my face
They say wealth is in the mind, not the pocket
I learned that from a very wise man
(Gotta pocket full of stones like Pimp say, this shit)
(Uh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Okay excuse me, Mr. Bill Collector, I got problems
My check arrive mañana, I'ma pay my debt, I promise
I spent 20 thousand dollars with my partners in Bahamas
Another 20 thousand dollars on Rick Owens out in Barneys
I said excuse me, why the fuck you lookin'? What's your problem?
I swear we gon' have drama if you touch my tailored garments
All you see is niggas here, so that means it's triggers there
What you mean? We got weed, and codeine and bricks for sale
I bet a lot of niggas plottin' so you know I got that heater, bruh
Drive my side of Harlem, catch me ridin' with my Nina, bruh
She got an apple bottom that remind you of Bonita, bruh
Oh, you mean like Q-Tip? Now that girl my new bitch
Excuse me, no, I believe the proper term's excuse you
I could switch up on you niggas and start shittin' if I choose to
That's when the new you becomin' different since they knew you
I guess the new me is just gon' take some gettin' used to

Excuse me, I tell them they're excused
What's the word around town, tell me what's the latest news
And uh, who them niggas, I tell 'em we them dudes
Ain't got time to make excuses bruh we steady making moves
And I, run the game even when they bend the rules
I pay very close attention after that I pay my dues
And uh, excuse me, may I be excused?
Cause I gave this shit my all, ain't got nothing left to lose

[Verse 2]
Tell me why these little niggas talking like they killas, bruh
Nowadays these niggas always caught up in they feelings, bruh
But I stay 100 cause you know I keep it trilla, bruh
Mobbin like 2Pacalypse or Bishop how I Hit 'Em Up
Fill 'em up with lyrics, bury all my victims, kill 'em
Dig 'em up again, to say I did it
Snitch, excuse me, mind your business, bruh
Swear that you could get it, girl
She a fashion killa, huh? Killa girl, I'm a go-getter, she get it, girl

You know us big mouth Harlem niggas don't know how to act

Talkin' 'bout we can't eat, talking 'bout we brand new guys
Tell them niggas "Suck a dick!"

It's animals in my projects, like monkeys, orangutans
Banana clip on that chopper, I hold heat, bangers bang

I don't care if you blue or you red flagging
Hair swinging, my pants sagging
Hoes all on my bandwagon, your bitch gagging, she jet lagging
All my cuz niggas, what's cracking?
All my blood niggas, what's popping?
I ain't set tripping, I just happen
To know who click-clacking, you mismatching
Fuck swagging, you been jacking, fuck fly, I am fashion
Tryna cop that Benz wagon, my bitch drive it, my friends crash it
Niggas threat with the chit-chatting, see a nigga don't shit happen

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
.345 be the big toy, now which nigga want it with the fat boy?
Uh, clipped-up like I'm paranoid, high as hell nigga, Fitzroy
Pull it off through the city like "errt"
Seen that ho nigga like "errr," hopped up on a nigga like murk
Put that pussy nigga in a purse
He wouldn't be the first, cover him with dirt (Yeah, uh, shit)
Put him in the ground, he was down to Earth
A napped up nigga, I been down since birth
Backpack full of random work
With two bad hoes, I'll teach you how to jerk
(Teach you how to jerk?) Swaggin' in my Js
Pop me a pill and throw that pussy a rave (Pussy a rave)
My prerogative ways
Nappy chin hairs with the brand new fade (Yeah)
Brand new nigga with the brand new venue
Sold that bitch out, shoulda made that ho bigger
Killing careers make these cupcakes remember
My objective is to serve your agenda
Biggie and Nas put they ass in a blender
Sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga
Equipped with a gat and a dick in your mouth
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house
Twisting up weed, I'm digging her out
Just filling her out
Do all that shit you be talking about
While you gone? Shit, Netflix on your couch
What this popcorn about?
Microwave oven while you out there cuffin'
You over there lovin'
That bitch be my stuffing, like, like we really be fucking
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Brand new clip, brand new nine
Brand new bitch, brand new ride
Brand new weed, brand new high
Brand new me, meet the brand new guys

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q & A$AP Rocky]
Brand new shirt to the brand new drawers
Brand new socks to the brand new Glock
This mothafucka hold 15, slap that ho in, tell the clip get lost
Bitch, I'm a boss, pulled up clean, don't you hear the exhaust?
Got my tie on, gripping on my iron on who I'm 'bout to fire on
Rap game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I rap for?
Crack game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I trap for?
Ridin' 'round with that mask on
Like a MAC attack when that strap on
Like a Shaq attack on that backboard, clap on, clap off
Blue pit in my back yard, red nose my bad broad
Titan full of that hydro, pretty nigga, no catwalk
Big burner in your big mouth, pussy niggas suck lead off
I pull it up then skirt off, vodka shots, he smeared off
40 ounce of that Cristal Rosé, that Rick Ross
Got it jumping like Kriss Kross, mismatching, no jigsaw
No horseplay when we quick draw, pussy nigga get a tit job
Hands up, stick your mans up, your time's up, the new brand's up

Ghetto Symphony Lyrics[Intro: Imogen Heap & A$AP Rocky]
Do just what I tell you (Uh)
Don't come in any closer (Uh)
And no one will get hurt
‘Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two (Uh)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A rebel I be one day
On that track with Gunplay
Out-outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like André (Uh)
Beef is on my entrée (Yeah)
Gin and juice, that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way (Uh)
Pussy on a Sunday (Yeah)
Business on a Monday (Yeah)
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway (Uh)
Come be my fiancée
She fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe (Yeah)
Dinner date for one K (Bitch)
Shopping date for two K (Bitch)
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days (Yeah)
Finally got it today (Uh)
Swear to God my mood changed (Uh)
Top off like toupees, drop off, touché (Bitch)
Yeah-yeah, my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy (Yeah)
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy (Uh)
Bounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holler at a nigga, G (Yeah)
Ridin' on my enemies (Yeah)
This my ghetto symphony-ny (Uh, yeah)
(Uh, yeah, uh, yeah)
(Uh, yeah, uh, yeah)
[Chorus: Imogen Heap]
Stop
Louder
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer

[Verse 2: Gunplay & A$AP Rocky]
Whip-whippin' Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and lockin' up my Swishers
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news, I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel (Uh)
Before I get aggressive forget it, war-ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
'Til my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that (Uh)
Black magic on the tires, only I
Roll-rollin' down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain, it may slow me down, cheer for it
Pain in its purest form
Don't complain, I came to reign from here forward
Still 'noid so crib got clear doors
Burnin' planes in my Air Force
And all I can see is Clearports (Uh)
[Chorus: Imogen Heap & A$AP Ferg]
Stop
Louder
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer (Uh)

[Verse 3: ASAP Ferg]
Since Rocky spit like André
I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée
Eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Body get found by a little fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenegger, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a 'roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
Fuck talking, how fast you could grip a 9?
Damn, look at how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit to crime
These niggas had the sidewalk sippin' wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq' so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe, I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died?
Never
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga121Embed

Babushka Boi Lyrics[Verse 1]
Uh
They call me F-L-A-C-K-O and don't play, no, 'bout my papes
Baked potato on that Draco, new bandana on my face
Ain't no stains up on my drapes, squeaky clean, fuck you say?
Peep them teeth, no dentures please
Princess cut, no dentist, please
Say cheese for the cameras (Ayy)
Eight Gs for the dancers (Ayy)
Benjis in the safe (That's right, ayy)
Bentleys for the phantoms (Uh)
But they all go to waste (Uh)
So what more can I say?
Praise to the Lord, give him grace
The scar on my face
But w-wait
[Interlude]
(​ecafracS ,sruoy si dlrow ehT)
The world is yours, Scarface, nigga
(​ecafracS ,sruoy si dlrow ehT)

[Verse 2]
I ain't duckin' niggas, I ain't duckin' bullets either
Shit, I ain't duck sauce since I became a vegan
Nigga, Flacko Jodye season
Prada pants before the season
Probably ducked off in a quiet place wit' ya breezy
Prada shades, that's probably why you couldn't see him
Shittin' me? (Boy)

[Chorus]
I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate this
To the scar on my face
Many stars on the globe
The world is yours, Scarface

[Verse 3]
Uh, fuck no, this ain't no hookah
Smokin' while I'm strollin' down Wooster
Buck fifty, my babushka
No pistol poppers and prostituters
Card scammers and the Prada boosters
Low top, yeah, the powder blue ones
Robber too, huh? Power to ya
Hallelujah, better pray to God
[Chorus]
I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate this
To the scar on my face
Many stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface

[Outro]
Uh, pearls and diamonds, that's excessive
Money, power, that's excessive
Money problems, that's expected
Marijuana, ass, and breastes
Pearls and diamonds, that's excessive
Money, power, that's excessive
Money problems, that's expected
Marijuana, ass, and breastes127Embed

PMW (All I Really Need) Lyrics[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
All I think about is life, nights, sipping on Sprite
Little codeine, nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little argument, and their fists don't fight
Fuck a dog ho and the bitch gon' bite
A$AP nigga, sip Cris all night
So them R. Kelly hoes getting pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice?
Young nigga cold like he sitting on ice
Fuck broke, tryna be rich all life
I coulda been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hanging, my top back
Hoes screaming that Pac back
Throwing Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, got a Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white but my cock black
Purple drink? Got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk something
Bounce on me bitch, hurt something
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth something
So shorty, she a stunner and daddy, he a runner
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shaking it fast and then making them stacks
And I'm taking it back and I'm taking her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kicking her out
[Bridge]
How 'bout me and you and you and I
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

[Chorus]
So I say pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
That's all a nigga need
[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
It's A$AP Q, where the bread at?
Fuck around and bring the hush puppies back
She fuck me and the homies, she was cool with that
The block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat
Pause a little bit, I gotta little advice
If you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night
Shorty got the booty make a nigga say, "Whoa"
Can I suck your titties, tryna see how far I can go
Try again and then again and she ain't telling me no
Sweetie tell me how you feeling, can I feel on you more?
She said, "I ain't fucking for free," but ain't shit I can't afford
Shit, I'll pay you for it, now bounce that ass on my bungee cord
Yeah, whoopsie daisy, put a good kid in your Section.80
Turn a baby into a lady, now here go the keys to my new Mercedes
Cause shawty she a stripper, all you got to do is tip her
She like ballers with some money screaming fuck them other niggas
Now do A through Z for a G, panties go down to her feet
Pussy get wetter for me, smackin' that ass to the beat, give her that Diggity-D
[Bridge]
How 'bout me and you and you and I
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

[Chorus]
So I say pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
That's all a nigga need105Embed
