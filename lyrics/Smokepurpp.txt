Gucci Gang fuck twin sisters
When I get a check, yeah, they call me mister
Call Mary Kate, wanna fuck her sister
They like, "Damn, Smokepurpp, how you do that?"
You just flow on a track and you kill that
And you thought you had the sauce but you spilled that
Put a hundred in the safe like at Chase Bank
Nigga, run up on me, see my bad side
Got a bad bitch and a backside
All this water on me like I'm baptized
They be switchin' gang, stay on that side
Bitch, I'm Lil Purpp, do a lot of fraud

Walkin' out of Gucci with a Louis bag

I don't wanna fuck a single bitch, I want a double
Bitch, I keep the piece like I came here with a puzzle (Grrt)

If you jump up in that water, best believe that shit deep

The money keep callin', you not in the race
This chain on my neck, I dare you to take it
As soon as you reach, I cook 'em like bacon

When I up, you better dip (Yeah), gon' hear a hundred gun sounds (Yeah)
Fuck nigga, we ain't playin' (Yeah), get to sprayin', I'ma lay 'em down (Yeah)

Fuck her, put a bitch on the jet
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Let's go)
Bad bitch, and I bought her some breasts (Woo hoo, yeah)
Fuck her, put a bitch on the jet
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Yeah, yeah, let's go)
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Ooh)
Bad bitch, and I bought her some breasts (Double D's)
Fuck her, put a bitch on the jet
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Let's go, yuh, yuh)
Bad bitch, and I bought her some breasts (Woo hoo, bitch)
Fuck her, put a bitch on the jet (Woo)
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Let's go, yuh)
[Verse 2: Lil Pump & Smokepurpp]
Get this shit off of my chest (Ooh)
On my Lord, I need a pint of the Tec (Yeah)
Invisible set, diamonds, they wet (Woo)
I bust a nut, then tell her to fetch (Bitch, aye)
This bitch got Corona, I don't wanna see her (No, no)
All these white hoes on my dick just like Bieber (Yeah)
I take a sixty and then had a seizure (Whoa)
I'm chargin' fifty-five pops for a feature (Yeah)
I-11 is closed (Huh?), ba-back to pimpin' these hoes (Ooh, brrt)
You gotta go (Go), still-still screamin' out, "Free Joe" (Bitch, yuh, yuh)
Your boyfriend is broke (Huh?)
You're mad 'cause his car got towed (Yeah, brrt, brrt)
Whip it up, both eyes closed (Whip, whip)
F&N hit him in that bone (Ayy-ayy, yeah)

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Woo hoo)
Bad bitch and I bought her some breasts (Double D's)
Fuck her, put a bitch on the jet
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Let's go)
Bad bitch and I bought her some breasts (Woo hoo)
Fuck her, put a bitch on the jet
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Let's go, yeah, let's go)
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Woo hoo)
Bad bitch and I bought her some breasts (Double D's)
Fuck her, put a bitch on the jet
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Let's go)
Bad bitch and I bought her some breasts (Woo hoo)
Fuck her, put a bitch on the jet
I had to get this shit off of my chest (Yeah)8Embed
