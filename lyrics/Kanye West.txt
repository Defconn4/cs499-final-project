[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yuugh! It's prime time, my top back, this pimp game, ho
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho
I'm bill-droppin', Ms. Pac-Man, this pill-poppin' ass ho
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin': that's exorcist
My Audemars like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time, and that's excellence
Two-door preference
Roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Hines is irrelevant, woo
Lambo Murciélago
She go wherever I go
Wherever we go, we do it pronto, it's like—

Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melting like Dalí

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz & Big Sean]
Okay, now catch up to my campaign

She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you— (Uh)

Monster Lyrics[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass
[Chorus: Kanye West & Jay Z]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert (Yeah)
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster
[Outro: Justin Vernon & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Head home)
I, I crossed the limelight (No, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th
[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

[Refrain: The-Dream, The-Dream & Choir, Natalie Greene]
(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war360Embed

What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walk-around-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch
[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)
[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One & Brenda Lee]
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Bound (Bound to fall in love)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept
[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh-huh, honey

[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One, & Brenda Lee]
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound to fall in love

New Slaves Lyrics[Intro]
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves
[Refrain: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison
Get your peace today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?
[Bridge]
Nothing bad, nothing bad, noth-
Noth-Noth-, -ing bad, noth-noth-
Bad, nothing bad, nothing

[Outro: Kanye West, Frank Ocean & Kóbor János]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt (mhm-igh)
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

Blood on the Leaves Lyrics[Produced by TNGHT, Kanye West, Mike Dean, Arca, Carlos "6 July" Broady, and 88 Keys]
[Intro: Nina Simone]
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah, I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me (Black bodies)
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you naughty
So let's get on with it
[Chorus 1]
We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

[Chorus 2]
You could've been somebody
We could've, ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia
[Bridge]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'd die for my...

[Verse 2]
To all my second-string bitches, tryin' get a baby
Tryin' get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to JAY-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant-ated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz, you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that
That go into that, all that money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh
Yeah-yeah, she got you, homie, yeah
'Til death, but do your part, uh
Unholy matrimony
[Outro]
That summer night holdin' long and long, 'din long
Now waiting for the summer rose and (Breeze)
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And live and learn
And live and learn
And livin' and livin' like I’m lonely
Lonely, lonely
And livin' all I have
And livin' all
And live

Black Skinhead Lyrics[Produced By Daft Punk & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
For my theme song (Black)
My leather black jeans on (Black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (Black)
Enter the kingdom (Black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (Black)
Came to see me in my black skin (Black)
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (Black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (Black)
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq, bitch
[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Refrain]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (Down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (Now)
But there's nowhere to go (Now)
And there's no way to slow (Down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
Early morning cartoon shit (Black)
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb, bitch (Black)
Black out the room, bitch (Black)
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (Black)
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened?
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready—ready for action—action

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
[Refrain]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (Down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (Now)
But there's nowhere to go (Now)
And there's no way to slow (Down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

Runaway Lyrics[Produced by Kanye West, co-produced by Emile, Jeff Bhasker, & Mike Dean]
[Intro: Rick James & James Brown]
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya (Ladies and gentlemen, ladies, ladies and gentlemen)

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find
Yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
[Bridge: Kanye West & Rick James]
Run away from me, baby
Ah, run away
Run away from me, baby (Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy (Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Then run away
Babe, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby (Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at ya)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy (Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Why can't she just run away?
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can (Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Twenty-four seven, three sixty-five, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of that advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day, you just up and leave

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

All Mine Lyrics[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & Ant Clemons]
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Pussy good, go 'n back it up
Pipe her up, I'ma pipe her up
Make her mine, I done fell in love
Juicy thing, make that pussy sing
One more time, baby, do it big
Make it cry, come boohoo this shit
[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy a sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it on girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now, let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome: me, you, and a blunt
I love your titties 'cause they prove
I can focus on two things at once
[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ayy, none of us'd be here without cum
Ayy, if it ain't all about the income
Ayy, ayy, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ayy, if you drivin' 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ayy, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

No More Parties In LA Lyrics[Intro: Johnny "Guitar" Watson & Junie Morrison]
La-di-da-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (La-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that body)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl in North Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, "Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, "K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy"
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money!)
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!
[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-
[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
Please, no more parties in L.A. (Shake that body, party that body)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh (Shake that body, party that body)
No more parties in L.A. (Los Angeles)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh

Let me tell you, I'm out here from a very far away place

POWER Lyrics[Produced by Andrew Dawson, Jeff Bhasker, Kanye West, Mike Dean & S1]

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment
[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Famous Lyrics[Intro: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Woo, woo
Swizz told me let the beat rock (Oh)
Oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah, we still hood famous
[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did

I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die
[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
Get 'em!

Real Friends Lyrics[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?
[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

[Chorus: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him
[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)
Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)
Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
'Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be
[Verse 3: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Lookin' for real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin (Yeah yeah)
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "What's up, fam? Hope you good"
You say, "I'm good, I'm great," the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus: Kanye West,  Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
Uh, I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him257Embed

Wolves Lyrics[Produced by Cashmere Cat and Sinjin Hawke]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lost and found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy found out
That you turned out how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
Love you (Got to)
Love you (Love you)
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost and found out
[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessy?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah, I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you
[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, on Caesar
You found me, in your gaze
Well, I found me, oh, Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I need you now
Lost and found out
Yeah
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impreg-a-nate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
Ayy, I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said, "Baby, what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?"
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph, around hella thugs?"
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves
(What if Mary) "What if Mary
(Was in the club) Was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?"
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
(And she was) We surrounded by
(Surrounded by) The fuckin' wolves150Embed

Ghost Town Lyrics[Intro: Shirley Ann Lee]
Someday, someday
Someday I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Someday, someday, someday
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Someday, somedays, I remembered this on a Sunday
Backway, yeah, way, way, burning, mhm-mhm
Uh, somedays, I wanna tell everybody
Somedays I wanna hit the red dot on everybody
Somedays, ohh (Heatstroke)
Now that I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana
Now that I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, oh, yeah
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Someday we gon' set it off
Someday we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what they had in mind
But maybe someday

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
[Outro: 070 Shake]
Woah, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free193Embed

I Love Kanye Lyrics[Verse]
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye76Embed

Gold Digger Lyrics[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion]
[Intro: Jamie Foxx and Kanye West]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me
(Uh)
[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

[Refrain: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm"
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her
[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

[Refrain: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his?
[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

[Refrain: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl
[Refrain: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

Faaaaaaaa— (Perfect)
Faaaaaaaa—
Faaaaaaaa—
Faaaaaaaa—
I told, I told, ayy-ayy, I told you

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Up in the mornin', miss you bad
Sorry I ain't call you back, same problem my father had
All this time, all he had, all he had
And what he dreamed, all his cash
Market crashed, hurt him bad
People get divorced for that
Dropped some stacks, pops is good
Mama passed in Hollywood
If you ask, lost my soul
Drivin' fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm comin' back
I'll be takin' all the stacks, oh
[Verse 2: Desiigner & Kanye West]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta
Stacks, oh
Credit cards and the scammers
Hittin' off licks in the bando
Takin' all the stacks, oh
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Stacks, oh
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Sellin' bar, candy
Man I'm the macho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga, pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me

[Chorus: Kanye West & Desiigner]
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I (Hey)
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I (Panda)
Panda, panda, panda, panda
Takin' all the stacks, oh
Panda, panda, panda
Stacks, oh
Takin' all the stacks, oh
[Verse 3: Desiigner & Kanye West]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twist the dope, lean and shit, sippin' Fanta
Stacks, oh
Credit cards and the scammers
Wake up Versace, shit like Desiigner
Takin' all the stacks, oh
Whole bunch of lavish shit
They be askin' 'round town who be clappin' shit
I be pullin' up stuff in the Phantom ship
I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti, whip look how I try this shit
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, killin' on camera

Can’t Tell Me Nothing Lyrics[Intro: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from
[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la (Ayy!)
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Haha!)
You can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Yeah!)
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life, homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, "Back in my day"
But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then
Aight, man, holla, then
[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard
Your homies looking like, "Why, God?"
When they reminisce over you, my God
[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Outro: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
(I'm serious, nigga, I got money)
