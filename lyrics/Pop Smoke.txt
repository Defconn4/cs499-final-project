Uh oh, my lil' mama sittin' pretty
And we be shoppin' through the city (Oh, oh)
I gave her keys to the Bentley (Woah, woah)
Get off your knees, you don't gotta cry to me
I'm your best friend, baby, you don't gotta lie
I'll get you everything that you want and you need from Chanel to Celine
It's on you to decide
Valentino, yeah, I put you in the best
Start liftin' up your dress, start kissin' on your neck (Oh no, no)
Start rubbin' on your butt, start massagin' your breasts
I ain't wanna give you a baby just yet, so I backed out and nutted on your breasts
I put you in a Uber (Uber) and sent you to your bed (Oh)
The very next day (Oh), you sent me a text (Oh)
You pulled up to the crib and we did it again (Oh, oh)

You know, I never found love until I looked into your eyes (Until I looked into your eyes)
First time blushin', I ain't even gon' lie (Ain't even gon' lie)
Four rounds in, leavin' bruises on your thighs
You the only bitch could make me spin off on the guys
And the only bitch that make me wanna nut when I'm inside
It's your vibe, leave with me, you gettin' high
Girl, ain't bitches fuckin' wit' you even if they tried
Pussy a tsunami, I ain't never fucked it dry
Close my eyes 'fore I sleep, hope you be there when I wake
Honestly, I feel the vibe we have is great
And if there's something in your mind, you can tell me
And if I told you what's on mine, would you help me?
You gon' see the bigger picture, it's just gon' take time
Just because you mine, I'ma keep you lookin' like a dime
Ain't no imperfections, girl, you fine
Baby, what's your sign?
I hope you ain't against the slow grind
(Work, work, it's me and you) Me and you
Keep it silent, there ain't nothin' we can't do
Through the storm, baby, we can make it through
Why you actin' brand new? You know you my lil' boo thang
Got up on my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin (It's hurtin')
She my biggest fan, she always lurkin'
And she know I'm a man, I'ma put that work in
I know she can't stand me, I'm fancy
So I'ma bring her out when I get my Grammy
Late night sex, she can't find her panties
Couldn't hold it in, now she need a plan B
[Chorus: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]
Shorty a lil' baddieShe my lil' boo thing

Baby OG, I been runnin' these streets, got the game from Lashawn, I'm my mama's son
Learned 'bout the triple cross when I was young and I know I ain't goin' so I keep a gun
I flew to Paris just to buy some Dior

Niggas pockets be on E
Something they already know but I'm drivin' a T
They makin' up rumors and lies, okay, I'm sick and I'm tired
I'm mighty fatigued, none of my bitches be mine
They coulda been one of yours, but they out of your league
I'ma just call up Fatimah
Nah, that ain't really her name, but she for the team

They limited, baby, tell me if you've seen 'em
My diamonds dancin', paint her face like Marilyn Manson (Marilyn Manson)
Then roll up that Woo, Runtz straight from Cali
Then get a plate from Sally's

Element Lyrics[Chorus]
I might just hit it raw, hold on, that's not my element
I like dark skins, love her melanin
Huh, Christian Louboutin what I'm steppin' in
Thirty bottles of Azul, tell 'em send 'em in
I had the Lambo, switch to the 'Rari
I'm a gangster, but I like to party
Pop a Perky, go retarded
I'm a Brooklyn nigga, I'm cold-hearted

That's why I like the bad gyal (Woah), like RiRi (Wait)
Every time she see me, she wanna eat me (Hold on)
I saw like Justin Bieber, please believe me
I said, "Wow, I'm on the TV"
I can't fuck with broke bitches, they be creepy
She be actin' up, she always tryna leave me
But she a bad gyal and she freaky
I have her hangin' off the rod like she MiMi
I never hit a bitch more than once 'cause they be leeches
But her pussy good, it taste like peaches
But she can have it, I don't need it
I'd rather have my money green like kiwi
I don't talk to niggas 'cause they be cappin'
Disrespect me and see what happen
I don't make a call for war, I start snappin'
Grr, them bullets blastin'
All the opps mad that I lapped them
He said, "What's stackin'?" Nothin' but my money
'Member my pockets flat? Now they chunky
I ain't a pretty boy, but I ain't ugly
And I'll take your bitch in a second
If she a real one, then I'll protect it
Traded the AP, told my jeweler Patek it
And it's all VVS and flower settings

I might just hit it raw, hold on, that's not my element
I like dark skins, love her melanin
Huh, Christian Louboutin what I'm steppin' in

Like Me Lyrics[Intro: PnB Rock & Pop Smoke]
Othello on the beat
You fire, ooh, ooh
You ain't never met another nigga like me
You say you lookin' for a man, you got the right one
She feelin' me, she say, "You so wavy, boy, you sexy, yeah, you fire"
Look

[Verse 1: Pop Smoke]
I'm like, "What's crackin'?" She like, "Pop, I got a man"
I'm like, "Damn, how you know me?" Say she got me on the 'Gram
I say, "Look, I understand, but baby, I'm the fan
'Cause you the baddest bitch I ever seen walk on the land"
She say, "What's that on your face?" And I say, "It's a cold world"
Way you bitin' your lips though got me like, "Oh, girl"
Get money and stay aggressive, baby, it's your world
Martin talkin' to Gina, baby, you go, girl
Who you with? I'm with the lions and gorillas, gangbangers and drug dealers
All them scammers and them killers who I hang with
Yeah, I taste good, ain't no onions on my sandwich
I'm 823 and everybody know I'm sanctioned
Why? 'Cause if I shoot, I'ma shoot that, woo and I'ma woo back
Yeah, I'm from the Floss, you know the language
I put it on the table so that everything is clear
Put them diamonds on your necklace to match them on your ear
She like, "Send me a text"
The end of the night, she was laid up in the bed
Liftin' up her dress, had her bent over the ledge
Kissin' on her neck when she went to give me head
What's next? Look
Let me fuck you, let me suck you, let me eat you, let me hold you
Let me beat up on that pussy like a real nigga's supposed to
If you ain't know I had the power, let me show you
Shark on your plate, we eatin' dinner at Nobu
[Chorus: Pop Smoke & PnB Rock]
You ain't never met another nigga like me
You say you lookin' for a man, you got the right one
She said, "Boy, you handsome, boy, you sexy, boy, you fire"
You ain't never met another nigga like me
Keep it real, girl, I'm lookin' for a wifey
She feelin' me, she say, "Boy, you wavy, you so sexy, boy, you fire"

[Verse 2: Pop Smoke]
I'ma call you every day at twelve o' clock, "How you doin'?" like Wendy
About your day and that new bag that I bought you from Fendi
I'ma treat you right as long as you let me
Louboutin and Giuseppes, all I do is chase fetti
Know I ride with that semi, so let me know when you ready
I'ma pull up in a Benz, just finished collectin' funds
Grabbin' on your ass, got a Rollie on my wrist
Baby, you could bring a friend, that's when the party begin
All them tigers on my collar ain't always just been Gucci
Ridin' past your block bumpin' YFN Lucci
You sayin' talkin' is cheap, so you know I had to prove it
So I made this song so you can add it to your music
I'm top tier, yeah, I ain't never kept it Nancy
But like Jamie Foxx, I'ma always keep you fancy
Gucci trench, feel like fishin' gear
Put me on any block, you know I'ma get it there
[Chorus: Pop Smoke & PnB Rock]
You ain't never met another nigga like me
You say you lookin' for a man, you got the right one

I just rolled a spliff and put it in the air
I'm big 092, niggas know I'm Woo (Woo)
I look a nigga in his face like "Who you talkin' to?" (Talkin' to)
I need 25K or I ain't walkin' through
I need 25K or I ain't walkin' through
I spent twenty on my wrist and twenty on a chain (On a chain)
I be spoiling myself so I can ease the pain (Pain)

Automatically on the blocked list (Blocked, bitch)
Niggas talkin' 'bout they guns (Guns), but never shot shit (Cap)
Might as well put a cap on it, all over with a chopstick (Pussy)
Run up and I'm brandin' them, take a nigga shoppin' (Bitch)
Reach and I'm branchin' it 'cause I don't know who watchin' (I'm on point)
It's a Ginger Ale and Henny day, eased up on the crème brûlée (Hahaha)
38's on the block (Bah), a nigga won't hesitate (Bah)
Had to move these bitches up (Move up) 'cause they was in the way
I wouldn't want them to get shot by an enemy
[Chorus]
I be in New York with the gangsters (And what's up?)
Know a nigga that'll shoot you for a 'Tander ('Tander, grrt)
If my opps is chillin' in the foreign (Bah, foreign)
Then my niggas shootin' up the Phantom (Phantom, bah, bah, bah)
I be in New York with the gangsters (Woo)
Know a nigga that'll shoot you for a 'Tander ('Tander, bah)
If my opps is chillin' in the foreign (You lackin' ass niggas)
Then my niggas shootin' up the Phantom (Grrt)31Embed

We gon' hit him and finish him, nobody innocent
If you ain't dead, better lay down (Lay down)
All the judge give us sentences, free all my menaces
All on the island like, "What now?" (What the fuck is up, nigga?)
Flossy the jungle where niggas gon' rumble
I aim at your head, we don't spray ground
We gon' shoot one or two, we gon' boom up the room
Back out the chop', we go spray rounds (Grrt)
See that .40 on me, roll a forty-clip
I bet I make his ass do forty flips (Forty flips)
Sheff G, sauce him up
Sheff G told me, "Sauce him up" (Sauce that nigga)

Bullets making him sleepy like Hallow
One in the head if a nigga wan' follow (Yeah)
Niggas only respect you because your brother (Uh)
Double-punched you and you called your mother (Uh, uh)
That's what brothers do for one another
That's the only reason I ain't put you under (Uh, uh)
That double G will make a nigga cry (Cry)
Smokin' big KiKi till a nigga high (Bye, bye)
I can't trust a bitch 'cause these bitches lie (Nah)
And that's how a couple my niggas died (Nah)
Yeah, I'm big 092, woo (Melo)

Bentley truck when I'm slidin', my bitches exotic, my hands off the wheel when I'm parking (Parking)
Jamos told me get the cash
Amiri the denims, don't ask what it cost though (Go get that cash, nigga)
He get nailed to the cross if he SRK
Let's talk about it if you feel a way (Grrt)
Nigga everything K
Big 24, don't call me bluff (Bah)
Kick down the door (Bah)
Big 092, show no remorse

Can't get you out, bitch, you a whore
For my lil' guy
D'usse on a floor (Uh)

Two liter Sprite (Sprite), I pour a four
Pull up TD, I got ten in my jeans (Uh)
Pop out with me, was on TV (Yeah, yeah)
