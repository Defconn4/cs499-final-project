Taste Lyrics[Intro: Tyga]
D.A.
Hah

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Slide on it pimp game with my pinky ring
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong words, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan
Aw, Mr. What-Kind-of-Car-He-In?
And the city love my name, nigga, I ain't gotta say it
[Chorus: Tyga]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same like Mary-Kate
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), let you get a taste
(Taste, taste), do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Lotta girls like me, niggas wanna fight me
Nigga, get your ass checked like a fuckin' Nike
Me not icy, that's unlikely
And she gon' suck me like a fuckin' Hi-C
Aw, chains on the neck for the whole team
And I feel like Gucci with the ice cream
And my bitch want the Fenty, not the Maybelline
I'm the black JB, the way these bitches scream
Make these bitches scream
Ah, pretty little thing
Like my nigga A.E.
Say, "Yadadadamean"

[Chorus: Tyga & Offset]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same like Mary-Kate
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), let you get a taste
(Yes, yes), do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool (Offset)
[Verse 3: Offset]
Yeah, I'ma put the drip on the plate, yeah (Drip, drip)
Diamond ice glacier, niggas imitate (Ice, ice)
Ayy, ayy, feed me grapes, Maybach with the drake (Grapes)
Slow pace in the Wraith, got this shit from bae (Skrrt)
Diamonds up to par (Par), the cookie hittin' hard (Hard)
The 'Rari sit in park (Park), on Addy on Mars (Mars)
Shotgun shells, we gon' always hit the target (Blah)
Popcorn, big shell poppin' out the cartridge (Pop it)
3400 Nawfside, Charles Barkley (Nawf)
4-8-8, Ferrari (Skrrt)
Make her get on top of me and ride me like a Harley (Ride)
She wanna keep me company and never wan' depart me, depart me (No)
Yeah, fishtail in the parking lot (Skrrt, skrrt)
I don't kick it with these niggas 'cause they talk about ya (Yeah)
Yeah, and I got the fire, don't make me spark it out ya (Fire)
Yeah, keep it in my back pocket like it's a wallet (Who?)
Like the way she suck it, suck it like a Jolly (Woah)
Stack it up and put it with the whole project (Racks)
And she got that Patek on water moccasin (Patek)
I'm rich in real life, I get that profit, copy (Hey)

[Chorus: Tyga]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), let you get a taste
(Taste, taste), do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me
[Outro: Tyga]
(Taste, taste), LA, you can get a taste

Stimulated Lyrics[Produced by Kanye West & Zaytoven]

[Intro]
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout
All a nigga hear is my chains clinkin' back and forth right now, nigga
Yeah, fuck with me

[Chorus]
Why the fuck you so opinionated?
Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it, baby
You need a demonstration?
This is how you get richer, baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated
I touched a bitch, she disintegrated
Up in flames, I've been the flamest
I've been the hottest, you've been the lamest
I've been on the plane, you've been complainin'
Fuck the co-defendant, pistol whip the plaintiff
Hit the mall, then we skip arraignment
They say she young, I should've waited
She a big girl, dog when she stimulated
[Verse]
Hit Sin City and syndicate it
All the time on the strip in Vegas
I got the juice but I ain't Minute Maid it
But a nigga made it just minutes later
Shut the fuck and let me finish, baby
I'll let you finish later
Why the fuck you so opinionated?
Yeah you book smart but don't be gettin' paper, uh!
Shootin' craps at The Wynn
Gettin' back to back wins
Made 20 bands playin' features
And I don't need a feature for this
Nigga I'm T-R-A, triple double
Every time I ball, man that's triple double
Tom Ford, Balmain, that's triple stuntin'
Tryna get a nut only gets you nothin'
So I don't give a fuck who these niggas datin'
Tsunami the Rollie, my wrist is flooded
How the fuck can these niggas hate it
When these bitches love it, man this shit is funny
All I can do is laugh, all I can do is laugh
They try to count me out, all day I'm doin' math
All I can do is add, multiply, multiply
All day I'm doin' math, but we won't divide
You ain't got the flow, you ain't got the heart
You be on your mark but you're never ready
You just talkin' shit, I can smell your breath
Sayin' what you do, but can't help yourself
[Chorus]
So why the fuck you so opinionated?
Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it, baby
You need a demonstration?
This is how you get richer, baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated
I touched the bitch, she disintegrated
Up in flames, I've been the flamest
I've been the hottest, you've been the lamest
I've been on the plane, you've been complainin'
Fuck the codefendant, pistol whip the plaintiff
Hit the mall, then we skip arraignment
They say she young, I should've waited
She a big girl, dog when she stimulated

[Bridge]
She a big girl, dog
Fuck what they talkin' about, nigga
She a big girl, dog
I'm gonna do what the fuck I wanna do when I wanna do
She a big girl, dog
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated
[Outro]
Might take her home, gon' and dinner plate it
I don't heat it up, don't microwave it
She already hot, she sizzle baby
No salt and pepper, she been the flavor
I'ma stimulate her, yeah simple, baby
Fuck with me, then I fuck with you
You don't fuck with me, my nigga fuck you too
She a big girl, dog
She a big girl, dog
She a big girl, dog
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated47Embed

Lil' bitch, my section is important

My bank account is enormous
Weed so loud it's distorted
Got champagne and we pourin' it
She poppin' it and she snortin' it
My iPhone recordin' it, if I want it, I can afford it
Bitch I'm Young Khalifa, fillin' my lungs with reefer
Somewhere in the clouds, gotta press up to see us
I gotta whip so fast that I caught a ticket speedin'
And my bitch so bad that I'm never ever cheatin'
I might pull up in some shit that you've never ever seen
And if I said how much I made, then you won't even believe it
Me and T-Y gettin' gnarly when we pull up to the party
Brought a whole pound of Mary

[Chorus: Siri]
And I can't seem to find

Smokin' on my reefer
She had me smokin', had me smokin'
Smokin' on my reefer

Tearin' up the place

Run up on me playin', I'ma aim it at ya face
And that go for anybody, anyway, ayy
I'm a rich blood, by the way
And I'm havin' swag, Rollie old like a tape
Fish scale, yeah, I got these bitches on the bait
Don't wanna talk, man, I said, I need some space
Woop, woop, woop, my new car geeked up
I just paid a cop, now I'm runnin' out of court
Panoramic top, I'ma put it on the rocks
Crawl, walk and hop, got all of these bitches shocked, ayy
Stone molly whiter than my socks
I don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout guap
Clone a young nigga and still flop
I buy pints by the two no Pac
[Chorus: Young Thug]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ah, rubbin' on my chain, blowin' cloudmatic
Smoke somethin' with a G and bend that ass backwards
Lay back, relax and talk mathematics
Later on, we test a little sex practice
Write my name on the wall
Money in the mattress, bet she wanna get involved
She hopped on the blunt, say, where the hookah y'all?
I tell her pass back if the shit too strong, it's all set
Mozart art on the block, so wet
I got her where I want her and I ain't done yet
Lookin' at your future, baby, put down the cigarette
Come hop on this kush jet and take flight, yeah
Tell them bitches, hmm fuck that
You with Aladdin, bet I got a magic carpet for that ass, yes
I'm also on one, got two Olsen's on me
Big homie, Young Thugger Thugger, rollin'
Rolls Royce so shorty
[Chorus: Young Thug]
Baby, pass me the hookah

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Ah, Ben Frank baddies in the Benz waggin'
You know she want a ride home, hop on the band wagon
I got the chain saggy, you know that life lavish
Lifestyles like this, gon' need Magnums
Pass baby, welcome to rich class, baby
You all Maybelline, with ya new Celine
Audemars on lean, cars on sheen
You white girl, but black girl ghetto fly thing
It's verified, they ain't on your sea level
Watered eyes, don't cry, inhale and breathe regular
My baby on it, high at the crack of dawnin'
Body shape, figure eight, like Picasso draw ya
Oh, yes, I'm winnin', bling kingin', ring blingin'
Like, like, for no reason, let's get closer, closed in
Remove your clothes, we close friends
Don't get choked smokin' OG Oakland, shout out Oakland
[Chorus: Young Thug]
Baby, pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah

Ayy, baby, just pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah, ayy

Faded like skinnys, Young Money we winning
I told her if I change, she won’t get a penny
Milking this shit, pregnant bitch titties
Bringing home the bacon, I’m fucking Miss Piggy
Loaded like a semi, send me naked pictures
She knows my dick, she call that nigga Richard
Prior to me cumming, I had to stick my thumb in
Her ass one time, smell my finger, make you vomit
Flyer than a hornet, the shoe fit; I worn it
She tried to jack me off, can’t beat it, join it
Tunechi, coochie, that what she call it
Flag, scarlet, I killed it, mourning

Switch Lanes Lyrics[Hook: Tyga]
Uhh, when I switch lanes, Phantom doors swing
Arm out the window screaming "Money ain't a thang"

Rari switch lanes, diamonds in my chain
Been around the world, all the hoes know my name
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang

Fuck a nigga up, Louie belt match the chucks
I'm in the club with Raww nigga, ten ratchets tucked
Back it up like a U-Haul, when cash is up
Spades in my ice bucket, rub that for luck
Racks in my cargos, Audemar stupid
Bitch say she in love with me, stay away from Cupid
The Panamera's sick, lupus
T-Raww, show them how we do it
[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ahh! Swoosh sign, do it
My new bitch a nudist, peace like a buddist
Cooler than Cool Whip, give brain, don't be stupid
Faded like Boosie, cut like a crew neck
Arm out the window, 'nother check, 'nother Rolex
Mo' less, the Moet, the mo' sex, I must say
I boarded the P-jet, more than a piss test
So wake up, I'm fucked up, my ex tryna make up

[Verse 3: Game]
Break up, telling these bitches to get their cake up
Wake up, shooting my babies all on her make-up

I walk in the spot, all the bitches bogart me
Spent 30 racks, I'ma make it back tomorrow
Pull up with a big titty bitch like Toccara

Love Game Lyrics[Hook]
The days go by, we argue all the time
I want to make it right, ‘cause that was last night
Baby we gon be alright, baby we gon be alright
Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart
I want to move on but my feelings too strong
I don’t wanna waste time, I don’t wanna waste time

[Verse 1 – Tyga]
Man I know we ain’t finished when it’s barely beginning
All the time I done put in, I put in but time was ending
So silly chasing a feeling, figured you felt different
But so many, so many girls but I just stay with ya
See love wasn’t my intention
Rather play Dominoes
Count money with my niggas, shoot dice
Give me seven, rolling out the gate, I hit it twice
Black Eyed Peas, money baby, it’s gon be a good night
And when I said I love you, yeah I fuckin’ meant it
And we ain’t gotta bring your moms and your sister in it
House too big, they all trying to spend the night
You always inviting them and I don’t even be liking it
At all, and I don’t even say shit
‘Cause I just like to see you happy even when you faking it
So flagrant you foul ass bitch, man I hate you
I hope we can make up in the A.M
[Hook]
‘Cause the days go by, we argue all the time
I want to make it right, ‘cause that was last night
Baby we gon be alright, baby we gon be alright
Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart
I want to move on but my feelings too strong
I don’t wanna waste time, I don’t wanna waste time
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea

[Verse 2 – Tyga]
Uhh, for every last king need a queen
If you love me now then forever hold this ring
Hold me down, defend it; hold me down, no witness
You always got so much pride but once you look in my eyes
It’s over, you even told me about you when you was younger
How your father abused you, I let you cry on my shoulder
No tissue, just short sleeve, tears see-through
Our lives equal, thinking what you been through
Uhh, yo Genie here
Yea I grant you every wish
Put you in environments, good company success
Already set, you going with the best
I know I lied before but trust me I ain’t like your ex
Sex so good, break up then break a sweat
We should stay together, then we fight again
Same old shit, different location
Feeling like my time wasted
[Hook]
‘Cause the days go by, we argue all the time
I want to make it right, ‘cause that was last night
Baby we gon be alright, baby we gon be alright
Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart
I want to move on but my feelings too strong
I don’t wanna waste time, I don’t wanna waste time
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea

[Verse 3 – Tyga]
Trying to forget someone that you love
Like trying to remember someone that you never knew
Think about it, I dream about it
My nightmares haunting me, I can’t sleep about it
Anxiety, can’t breathe, can’t live without you
The revival, all these verses is my survival
Standing at the podium, waiting on your arrival
One day but no return
Like Usher say, gotta let it burn

[Outro – Tyga]
The hardest part of dreaming about someone you love
Is waking up to see that person gone
You know it, it it takes seconds to say hello
But forever to say goodbye
Moving on is easy, but what you leave behind
Is what makes it hard…26Embed

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T-Rawws rock my own kick game
8 figure deal figure how I'm courtside at clip game
Still pop ace king shit I'm with Rozay
Black Maybach leather gloves on that OJ
OK the day you beating me bitch no day
Bandz a make her dance that's thousand dollar foreplay
AK get a full clip not a soundwave
You kissed her in her mouth, ask her how my dick taste
Bitch nigga you don't want no drama, I'm worth a couple commas
It's death before dishonor
Last King come sign up, all my shit be designer
Extroardinary rhymer I bodied yo' shit for nothin'

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
H on the Buckle, Hermes and the hustle
Crown on the watch, young niggas still thuggin'
8.7 on the crib so fuck it
Went gold in a month so it ain't no budget
New chains, rolex links
New chick just to drag my mink
New car just to ride 'round here
Aviator crew we flyest 'round here
Hating on hood niggas dying 'round here
Bath Salt Boss, got insurance on the beard
Cars rockstars, dope boys at odds
I done seen it all but it's back to these broads
Hands clap like a nigga in the stadium
Million dollar chain but I'm rocking 8 of 'em
I see you slipping boy don't make me pick your label up
Scottie Pippen on the dribble I just laid 'em up
Another triple got me tripping like it's angel dust
We just winning all the women in my table ah
Say my name say my name nigga say my name
Hundred million dollar nigga, nigga say my name

Off topic, get on top it, what’s your synopsis
So sincere in her belly, that's that Nas shit

Pardon this good regime, I make your girl David Blaine

For the Road Lyrics[Verse 1: Tyga]
They say what goes around comes around (round)
And I know I made mistakes and you forgave me how (how)
I don't understand, you know I'm trying the best I can (can)
I guess it's consequences when you dealing with sin (sin)
And even sacrificed your friends over me
All them nights in the club turn to nights with me
It's like the same old story out your diary (diary)
Memories never fade but only in time we'll see (see)
Hope to see you with me 'cause...
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up
But my heart beats for you, baby, I’ma go and scream it loud
But if you leave, it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road
[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, grippin' and biting
Remember the times after fighting
You said you loved me, I liked it
Became obsessed with the sexing
You screaming, “Whose is it?” we naked
Now I'm pullin' your hair told you take it
A couple of shots, now we faded
Don't even know we made it, we home
Got that look in your eyes like hope you mine
Said you hoped the feeling’s real, really tired of all the lies
One minute we fine, then we not, everything I do you can't
But that's no reason for making mistakes, this time put it all on the plate
I, I told you be loyal, spoil you, never disown you
You get lonely when I'm touring, just hold it down ,be supportive
I'll be back in the morning, that new purse you wanted
What's good if you can't flaunt it (flaunt it), show it
Ain't the same, better than the rest (rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to make, make you understand, make you understand that

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one (oh, for you)
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up (oh, made mistakes, I know I fucked up)
But my heart beats for you, baby, I’ma go and scream it loud
But if you leave, it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road
[Bridge: Chris Brown]
All I ever wanted was your happiness
But right now let's get right down to it, let's handle this business
If you gonna leave me tonight, I gotta kiss it goodbye
Girl, I'm 'bout to make it cry, and all I need is one more time 'cause my...

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Last time, best time, better than my next time
Rolex and vest time, Moët it's sex time
Hard to let go, a part of you gon’ be alone
Scrolling your phone, looking at texts, seems like not too long ago
Ain't the same better than the rest (rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And it's no way I can pay you back (back)
But my plan is to make, make you understand, make you understand that

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up
But my heart beats for you, baby, I’ma go and scream it loud
But if you leave, it's something I can't control

Ice Cream Man Lyrics[Hook]
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
She like to twirly swirly, in my vanilla coupe
She like my sugar cone seats I just took off the roof
She got a marshmallow booty, I like to sprinkle it too
I'm the ice cream man, this my song when I'm ridin' through

[Verse 1]
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
All these money hungry hungry hippos wanna love me
All these diamonds dusty, mine just clear and sunny
I don't rock Giuseppes, nah them shits is ugly
I'm in the ghetto, the gutter, I got the sugar the butter
I got the mama the brother, oh yeah your son is a hustler
She wanna fuck and suck, but I ain't gon' rush it
I'm the ice cream man, I ball every summer
These boys wanna run it
That's cool cause I need more runners
Tell 'em get me more condoms, we doin' more fuckin'
[Hook]
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me

She like my sugar cone seats I just took off the roof
She got a marshmallow booty, I like to sprinkle it too
I'm the ice cream man, this my song when I'm ridin' through

[Verse 2]
Banana clip, bandana tied around my head
Bandana bread we gettin' fed
I like my pie a la mode
She instagramming a move, a pic of me and my gold
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I don't rock Giuseppes, nah them shits is ugly
I'm in Saint Laurent, candy paint Ferrari, baby lick this caramel
A Bathing Ape That camo, I came with an army
She wanna fuck then suck me, I think it's Sunday Monday
Tuesday I be busy, Wednesday I be out the country
When the club is jumpin' tell them niggas cut the bungie
Tell 'em cut the check, my number's jumpin'

[Hook]
She like to fuck me, suck me, suck then fuck me
I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey

Chiraq To LA Lyrics[Intro]
187
[Verse 1: Tyga]
Know some Hoover niggas that's down to ride
For a homicide, when its drama time
Niggas thinkin' that they MCs
Can't get touched, well its hammer time
Who the fuck is Lil Durk?
I dust you like ash and purp
Your flow wack, my flow crack
Got marble floors, your floors crack
Got rap shit, mice traps
These niggas broke, need ankle wraps
Don't ride around in LA, if you ain't come on the jet with the strap
My niggas 52 Orange roofs, orange coupes, Ciroc orange juice
Trel said fuck all you, my OG Chimp out soon
H rat, shout out ScHoolboy Q, still my dog
You're a real one, I owe you
Shot at them niggas when you heard the news
If your daughter ever need something, don't hesitate I got you
Posted up on sunset at the House Of Blues like it's all cool
Might get trapped in Vegas too, call Mally Mall he with Big U
I might be in Bel Air, still got niggas in the field
20 million, LK real
With Yeezus in that SLR, T Raw upper echelon
No Lil Jets just G5's
Free CB, H Rat, Lil Punch and baby Nitty
My Maybach cost 2 chickens, you ain't got one? Don't talk my language
I’m king shitting on yo bitch
Southpaw and we in the gym
Tryna be a baller? End up like Flip in "Above The Rim"
You too small like Smeagol
I’m swatting the mosquito
I’ll put you under the earth now it’s a garden on your tombstone
You shit stain teenagers, barely teething on hundos
I'll hold you like the slave you are, all my whips mayo
You from Illinois? I'll bring the noise
You ain't platinum? Don’t talk to me. Grammy nominated? Don't talk to me
20 Million? Don’t talk to me
It's levels to this shit boy, you basement? Don't talk to me
You want the fame? I'll take your name and that weak bitch you fall asleep with!
[Verse 2: Game]
Ain't got no time for this rap shit, Blood Money, Cash Money
Ain't got no time for this rap shit, Cash Money, Blood Money
Ain't got no time for this rap shit, rap money, drug money
I'm straight nigga, straightjacket!
Yo Trel let a nigga hit him with a ratchet
Big U let a nigga get some matches
I'ma torch the building this La Familia
Pull up and spin a nigga backwards
Light it up, smoke a nigga like a Backwood
(Gotta channel DMX)
Coming through with my dogs (grrrrrr)
That chopper going through walls
This beef shit? That's me shit. Pull up bangin' that Meek shit
That monster truck pull up side of that Benz?
(Niggas ain't saying nothin')
Choppers aimed at yo whip, nigga!
(Niggas ain't saying nothin')
Cash Money, Family Hustle like Tip, nigga!
(Niggas ain't saying nothin')
Come through, few Bloods, few Crips, nigga!
(Niggas ain't saying nothin')
T Raw? I got you, don't trip, nigga!

First off lemme go on 40 Glocc again
Talk about my kids on Instagram?
Nigga must wanna get his ass socked again!
Tell a lie like I pulled out a Glock on him
Don't make me resurrect Pac again!
You ScHoolboy like Kendrick and Top and them
Have a bitch nigga running to the cops again
It's all Gucci Mane, Waka Flock and them
(Green Light)
That mean go nigga, if you ever see this ho nigga, on mama nigga it's a
(Green Light)
From where my nigga died to Riverside, even your niggas know it's a

Better run through the red ones, fuck around and be a dead one
(Jump in the middle of beef, cause I don't like no one)
(Step behind these bars and I don't write not one)
(Niggas bumping they lips but they don't like no guns)
(Just close your eyes and that light gon' come)
I don't fuck with no new niggas, they like to sue, no woo nigga
Tyga hit me like "Durk dissing"
Dirk Nowitzki? Dirk who nigga?
Never heard of these niggas
Some of the nerve of these niggas
Don't make me put on burgundy nigga
Let the AK [gunshots] I'm serving these niggas
Yo T raw, time to murder these niggas
Black suburban these niggas
I'm taking bitches, I'm taking chains, yeah I'm Young Bergin' these niggas
Ain't start making guns when they made you nigga
Ain't no Jayhawk but I'll K you nigga
And I know Hoovers, I know 60s
(I know Westside Pirus, niggas down to die too)
Move in on them 50s
(I got niggas on west and the Southside of Chi too)
Pull up in an 87 Cutlass
Throwing bullets like Jay Cutler
Fuck this, what's this? Niggas talking all that fuck shit, tough shit
Put a nigga on like Trukfit
I know Lil Wayne, I know Lil Reese
I know Lil Herb, I know Lil Keef
I know Lil Boosie, that nigga free like this ass whooping
Come fuck with me, I got hands, I got bands
Got damn I am what I am
.45 go blam with no jam
Bring a nigga Vietnam, let's go ham
Niggas runnin' out of ham, let's go spam
Nigga dip through your set like Killa Cam
I'm talkin' to the man, with no fans
This is a DM with no gram
Ridin' through the Chi, ain't ever seen Oprah
Hit a 300 with my little nigga Sosa
Brown paper bag, sippin' on a Four Loko
Nigga get love, I ain't talkin' 'bout The Notebook
Niggas got killers out here, west side, they feel us out here
Like Weasel Sims and Chicago, realest out here
Old man and the capitol hill is out here
On the low end, all my BD niggas bring the dope in
BD twins locked up in the feds and my nigga Bump J, hold your head
If you getting money nigga hold your bread
Rock my Pelle P like L.E.P., them Bogus Boys? They Fuck with me
I fuck with stones till I OD'
69, Seven Deuce
Marshalville I mean Murderville
Yellow G, gave me a bitch off of Damen Ave I use her to kill
She from the Chi, but she ain't shy
She ain't never met a nigga who can't die
I'm so Southside I'm so Northside
I'm so Westside, nigga "Ain't I?"
Got more niggas in the Chi than Jay
(Chi than Jay)
I might be more Chi Town than Ye'
(Chi Town than Ye')
I'm on the low end with my nigga Parkay
(with my nigga Parkay)
And he A GD, but it's free Bump J
4CH but I'm like Barksdale in this Shark Tale
OG like a car sale
Chopper spins, you do cartwheels
Lil Durk under a lil dirt
(And nobody knows you)
Dis ain't what they want!
(Nobody knows you)
(Bitch I thought that was Future's song!)
(I'm bout to show you)
You done caught yourself a Little L dog
(Man nobody knows you)
You heard of Lil Durk?

I’m Gone Lyrics[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, looking around glass, my future is in the past
I'm re-arranging my life, I'm single and now I laugh
All of the moments we had, beginning and just the end
At the end, still ain't friends, heard I was on your hit list
Damn, now I'm driving Ferrarris, fucking random bitches
People saying I made it but I don't feel too different
Wayne told me, "Close your eyes, they'll never see your vision"
So I stay ready to die behind these Biggie lenses
Reinventing, Audemars/Breguet shit
Just left the hood, word to the 5th Dist
Bout to cop a G, tear the roof like Diddy
And my city color purple nigga, no Celie
It takes time when you plotting on the beat
I kill it, I bet I kill it, producer witness to see
Bitches stand on their feet, handicapped, get out your seat
Got that buzz, Lil B, sting a bitch, Ali
Hah! Comparing tighter rappers, but my songs greater
Just compare me to dope dealers and ballplayers
Cause I'm a dope ass nigga and I ball, player
Never save a ho, can't even get a life saver
She gon fuck our way to the top and fall later
So I'mma fuck her, never call her later, uh
Skinny nigga got my weight up
Middle finger to my haters, why you chasing?
We ain't racing muh'fucker, I'm gone!
[Chorus: Tyga]
Middle finger to my haters
Muh'fucker why you hating? I'm gone
I ain't really wanna do it
But I did it to 'em, nigga I'm gone
Leave the beat shit alone
Leave the bullshit at home, I'm gone
Even though I'm out of here
Nigga gotta keep it real, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Tyga]
She fuckin' with me, these niggas ain't fuckin' with me
Got my mind on my money
My money piling up hundreds
You say you did it, I done it, you old nigga, I'm younger
You fold up under pressure
I'm good straight in the stretches
Uh, bitches pecking my wood: wood chucka chucka
Never gave two fucks: double rubbers
Now your color turn your face to a red gusher
And your girl stick it to me like a car bumper
Never depended on anyone co-dependent
Kept my thoughts to myself, I don't need opinions
No middle mans, in the middle of my sands
Niggas think they sweet, they can't even pay their incidentals
I'm detrimental, on any instrumental
I ain't pulling teeth, nigga better hide your pillow
Chew these rappers to the fucking gristle
Bad to the bone, red zippers, Mike Jizzle, nigga gone
[Chorus: Tyga] X2
Middle finger to my haters
Muh'fucker why you hating? I'm gone
I ain't really wanna do it
But I did it to 'em, nigga I'm gone
Leave the beat shit alone
Leave the bullshit at home, I'm gone
Even though I'm out of here
Nigga gotta keep it real, I'm gone

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
B-I-G, Finally Famous in this...
I say, fuck sleep, stayed up, fuck you, pay up
Always got the paycheck, never took a pay cut
Payday will be worth all the broke nights I stayed up
So in my cup, I'm mixing up whatever dreams are made of
Not too many young G's made it where I am
So I was waiting on a doctor man, patient as I am
I guess a young D-boy made it into a man
With girls half-naked around like we finna land in the sand
Red-eyes to Rome and they connecting to France
With some bomb-ass pussy, that bitch came straight from Iran
My jewelry made in Japan, I'm off California drugs
And where I made my money, huh? Nigga, all of the above
I could count my inner circle on my hands and my feet
Passing joints long as a branch cause it's family tree
Doing kush-ups man cause the weed too strong
I'm a G + 1
What's that motherfucker? That's gone
Said I'm a G + 1
What's that motherfucker? That's gone, bitch16Embed

She got her booty cheeks on my Louis sheets
She can do it on a pole, but can she do it on me
Her flexing ass, let me see you flex that ass
I don't call I just text that ass and buy special bags
Python, all gold no ice on
Nothing but shaved pussy in my iPhone
And this right here a no fly zone
And you are not us, so don't try, holm'
I buy cars, I buy homes, my antidote for my catapult
I'm up through there, foreign shoes, these a new pair
Chains on, this two pair, make your girl buy new hair
Wear that pussy out, like new gear, ho

You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you

And I want you to want me too
You a one of one

Now you wearing bandanas, rocking your man's flannels
Flight to Dubai, gotta pop a Xanax
Mi no love for dem batty boy antics
Gon' make me pull choppers out the attic
I'm a savage, straight savage
Yeah, they laughed at my dreams of livin' lavish
We no pretender, we both remember
All these hoes was ghost 'fore I had the Phantom
'Fore I had the 'Gram, I couldn't get at 'em, uh
Before I rocked rings like Saturn
They ain't wanna hang out when I try to plan it
That's why I give all I have to you
They don't know I got the juice (They don't know)
They don't know I touch the money like masseuse (Dem don't know)
I was made custom for you
Only give my loving to you
[Chorus]
You, you my only one
You, you a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one
You, you a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you

[Outro]
Back to the front with you
Yeah, grind and bump with you
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
Back to the front with you
Don't have to front, it's true, yeah
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one with you
One on one
And I want you to want me too
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you18Embed

I'mma be there in a minute down, drop that towel and its going down
Pull up on your block, all the neighbors watch
Little things, tell you you're pretty, know you get that a lot
Eyes from a distance, his and hers, gold watch
Everybody seen you, with them now them heels, sold out

But I'mma get it, cause it's that important
Had to hit up your so called 'friends', man, them bitches annoying
I'm on the road, tell me what you're doing
I got that O-love for you, don't let it ruin
How about you come see LA, like a Bruin
Focus on on what we got going, not what everybody else doing

They on the same thing and we changed up, they thirsty
Drop the top, California never rains
I feel your love and pain is crazy babe, cause

Make It Work Lyrics[Produced By: SAP]

[Intro]
Aye, nigga, what that work like?
Aye, bitch, what that work like?
You know me I've been trappin' with it all night
Niggas wanna take it there, we can take it there, all night

[Verse 1]
Aye nigga, Raww with the drama
I'll bring it to your face, cook it like Benihana's
Then ride out on Yokohamas
And my fingernails dirty, I've been countin' straight 100's
Why these niggas wanna test me on the low though?
Got no mothafuckin' patience so I'm patient with the scope though
Put your potty mouth on the low
Sleepin' with the enemy, It's like hangin' on a rope
Jim Carrey, I ain't fuckin' with you liars
All black attire, if we match it fuel the fire
This time man we aimin' for the body
I'm puttin' X's on the wall, if you resurrect, you Makaveli
Sphinx, I'm a pharaoh, ain't a fairy
Potato on the barrel, watch your soul fly like a sparrow
All my niggas thorough about dinero
Nigga never was my homie, all these bitches know you're corny nigga
[Hook]
Aye, nigga, what that work like?
Aye, bitch, what that work like?
You know me, I've been trappin' with it all night
Niggas wanna take it there, we can take it there all night
Aye, nigga, what that work like?
Aye, bitch, what that work like?
'Bout your money, you've been trappin' with it all night
Bitches wanna take it there, you gon' take it there all night

[Verse 2]
I make that money reappear
Hoppin' off the Lear, ain't no passengers in here
I got D'usse poppin', no beer
Why you in my ear? I can't hear the money clear
When I'm back in the city and it's clear
My name in the sky with the lights on the field
I'm a gold chain buyin' pioneer
Got that ricky in the trunk and I pop it if a nigga near
Papa's got a brand new bag, baby, Goyard
Cash, baby, Maybach rag, baby, yeah, baby
LK frames on the dash, smashin' the fast lane
With a baddy, mane, ass, got a fatty, mane
Tattoos, Vera Wang, G5, hydroplane
Last Kings, everything (everything?) everything
Cartier love rings, but this ain't no love thing
Married to them green things, Franklins and money trees
[Hook]
Aye, nigga, what that work like?
Aye, bitch, what that work like?
You know me, I've been trappin' with it all night
Niggas wanna take it there, we can take it there all night
Aye, nigga, what that work like?
Aye, bitch, what that work like?
'Bout your money, you've been trappin' with it all night
Bitches wanna take it there, you gon' take it there all night

[Outro]
Take it there all night, nigga
We can take it there all night, nigga
Gettin' money all night, nigga
And your bitch with me all night, nigga
We can take it there all night, nigga
Take it there all night, nigga
I'll be on the first flight, nigga
You ain't on this jet flight, nigga

T-Raw
Last kings, bitch!57Embed

Muthafucka Up Lyrics[Verse 1: Tyga]
YMCMB, rawest niggas doing it
School for the blind, I don't see these niggas doing it
I’m doing it and doing it and doing it well
Niggas wanna test me boy, who wanna fail?
Hit you like a bully bitch, yeah saved by the bell
If you scared, go to church I’ll see you in hell
And your girl, she a flip, give me heads or tails
Everybody fake so I got real for sale
Gunpowder fill the air
Rappers shittin’ on theyself, you could smell the fear
And these bitches laying flowers cause the king is near
T-Raw this is the new flavour in ya ear
Niggas softer than baby hair
Why you acting tough, heard you work at Build-A-Bear
I’m a dealer all my girls come in deuce and pairs
I’m in the building I construct so crank this muthaf-cker up
What the funk you beezy’s want
I’m ready to hump the car I call it ele-phunk
Trunk in the front
Man she give me good brain till she feel dumb
I just keep going like the bunny till I feel numb
Yeah these bitches want it
I put my man’s on it
That 110 Sup’, and that Ferrari California
Niggas want beef, call me Tony Roma
You potatoes on the sofa
Lazy motherfuckers, why you ain't even try yet?
Rich or die trying, why you niggas ain't died yet?
Wings tattoo yeah forever on some fly shit
And I’m with the business, get (pyoom!) with a tied clip
Stay on the flight yeah I’ma trip
Probably up in Paradise chillin like Parliaments
Flow got a boner, you could say I’m on some harder shit
Bout to make the speaker buss’
[Hook]
(Crank this muthafucka up)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, really, I get money
I get money like a bitch
She ain't going nowhere but swear that bitch a trip
You see how the diamonds get to dancing
Yeah, ya money short, get some pants and shit
I be with a nigga with a big ol’ dick
Yeah I like them balls you be shooting them bricks
Fuck you in the game for?
Bitch we up three-zip and it's Game 4
Tell ‘em listen, couple bad bitches’s
Out in Kingston kicking up bricks and shit
Intervention bitch I pay ya pension
Oh you say what? I don’t pay attention
Yeah these niggas want it
I put my bitches on it
You know the tattoos got Nicki initials on it
I put the pussy on ‘em, cook ‘em a pot roast
Then pull off in the Ghost
Bitch I do the most

[Verse 3: Tyga]
What the funk you beezy’s want?
It ain't your turn, better have my money
Friday like Big worm
Can’t see you niggas, you like a little germ
Bitches know I’m excellent like Mr. Burns
See my dick like butter churn
Baby churn and ya girl with me fo’shure
That ain't your concern
She forgot about her man, she will never learn
On a mic 'til I die, RIP Chick Hearn
Yessir, colder than the Pittsburgh winter
Fresher than a Will Smith T-Shirt
Disperse coming through Last King and a hearse
Ask later, shoot first, got shooters like Dirk
When it hurts leave you losers bruised up
Bruce Lee nunchucks
Toe from the floor up though
Duck, rubber duck now you like oh shucks
Tell the neighbours I don’t give a fuck

Bottle, tonic, gin mixed in
Snoop house shoes, getting down in the kitchen
Ayy, I'ma socialize at a distance
I'm living my best life, minding my business (My business)
And my antisocials for the win, win
Locked down, I'ma stay stayin' in, in (In, in)
Ramen noodles every night for my din-din
Hulu, binge watchin' episodes of Ben-10 (Yeah)
And I got T-Raww for assistance
Bad boy, I'ma have to ball like a Piston (Yeah)
In quarantine, I'm the quarterback (Quarterback)
MVP how I'm scoring that (How I'm scoring that)
And the food here, shout out DoorDash (Shout out DoorDash)
Where the napkins? I need more of that, ayy (I need more of that)
Can't find the remote, outta control
Outta my mind, outta my hands, outta my soul
Honor the code, got my locks blo'-blonded in gold
I'm in the house and I'm so damn bored (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'm in the house like Cory
Where you could find me like Dory (Dory)

Sonnin' 'em all like I'm Maury (Maury)
