PRBLMS Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
And she said... "You a goddamn lie"
I ain't mean to say that shit, girl, I was goddamn high
So we left the crib now we in the goddamn ride
She lookin' goddamn fine
I wanted a bitch who was down to Earth
But she want the goddamn sky, uh
List of my problems
Got this one on my line that won't stop fucking callin'
It's crazy I made her that way
Every time I see her out, I see the hate in her face
Like why you do that?
Tell her you love her when next week you just want your space
Why you do, why you do that?
Tell her you want her but next week you do your own thing
Why you do, why you do that?
I can't explain it but just know it working for me
She text me “I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you”
But how the fuck can you hate me?
When I ain't did shit, but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I never been the one to try to explain
While you catch them feels I'ma sip on this drank, it's easing my brain
[Chorus]
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit
('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit
('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank

[Verse 2]
Now I'm like
It's a goddamn shame
We done crashed, we done burned
But baby you the goddamn blame
See I wanted love but you wanted goddamn fame
Every goddamn thang
I wanted a bitch who was on the move
But you want to goddamn lay
Uh, list of my problems
Got this one in my bed and she just wants to sleep
Fucking up all of the sheets
She only wake up to eat
Do this shit every week
Like, why you do that?
Crying you want to be great, but sleepin' until the next day
Why you do that?
Don't got that much in the bank, we go out she order the steak
Why you do, why you do that?
She can't explain it but just know it working for her
She claiming she down on her luck but really she don't give a fuck
And I cannot make this shit up
And I ain't did shit but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I won't be the one to try to explain
While you catch them feels, I'ma sip on this drank, it's easing the pain
[Chorus]
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit
('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit
('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank152Embed

Pretty Little Fears Lyrics[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Do better, who better? You better?
Been around, like hella propellers
Wanna know who you with, don't tell 'em
Come on, fellas, that ain't none of your biz'
Got on your bodysuit, you know I'm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today?
She know my stick nuttin' but magic, babe
I be swinging it back and forth 'til you in your casket, bae, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK]
Girl, you want my best side, mmm
Bet she from the Westside, mmm, mmm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Okay, say it loud, say it proud, you want it more
We open door, hit the couch, then the floor
I cut it up, like a scissor, love galore
She never bored, there's so much shit we can do
You free to say whatever, baby, if you asking me
No limit when I'm in it, got a Master P
I'm hoping I don't have a fast release
Got me focused like I'm out here tryna get my master's see, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK]
Throwin' up the peace sign, hmm
Girl, I'm from the Eastside, mmm, mmm
Girl, you on my best side, mmm
Say she from the Westside, mmm, mmm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I'm loving your light, vulnerable
Letting your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you, but there’s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
And keep alive in the winter time, ayy, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me, I could take the weight
Up off your shoulder blades and try to store the pain inside of me
Ayy, why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
Beautiful Black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you, this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart, 'cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord
[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Say she from the Westside, mmm
And she see my best side, mmm, mmm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears

Free Lyrics[Intro]
Okay

[Verse 1]
Why am I waking up out of my sleep
Thinking of ya babe
You had a hold on me
Now I'm feeling freer than I ever been
You been around love but you never been in

[Pre Hook]
Um, ay, running out of shit that I can say
Wishing you the best and so I pray

[Hook]
I’ve been waiting for the day
You know it was coming either way
I know that you hate it
But I’m freer than I’ve ever been
Something that you’ve never been
[Verse 2]
You had just what you needed to be
Everything you want to be
But you'd rather run round these streets
Now you're feeling freer than you've ever been
But really you feel trapped, no need to pretend

[Pre Hook]
Um, ay, running out of shit that I can say
Wishing you the best and so I pray

[Hook]
I've been waiting for the day
You know it was coming either way
I know that you hate it
But I'm freer than I've ever been
Something that you've never been

[Bridge]
I know you don’t wanna fuck nobody but me
You don’t wanna touch nobody but me
Nobody
Nobody
You wanna be

[Verse 3]
Saved, I’m hoping that you found a way
I’m moving around state to state
I’m living I know you can’t relate
Now I’m feeling freer than I’ve ever been
You know I was down
Now I’m on the fence
Ah, ay, a lot of bitches wanna ride the wave
Most of them was out to take your place
You done went and gave that shit away
[Hook]
I’ve been waiting for the day
You know it was coming either way
I know that you hate it
But I’m freer than I’ve ever been
Something that you never been42Embed

Luving U Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah
Do you still scroll through them texts messages?
This henny got me thinkin' 'bout the things that you said
It was real
For real
Up for three weeks
Feeling half past dead
Sitting here reflecting
On what's in my head
And how I feel
For real

[Pre-Hook]
I'm running low so don't play with my time
I'm searching but it's nothing left to find
Send out a call but no one's on the line
So if you want it please make up your mind
Please make up your mind
[Hook]
I don't wanna lose myself loving you (You, you)
Loving you
I don't wanna lose myself loving you (You, you)
Loving you

[Verse 2]
You know everything 'cause I put it in my songs
If I tell you that I'm working, I ain't out doing you wrong
I got too much on my plate to add some shit that I don't need
I ain't asking you for space just some room to fucking breathe
But I can't stress myself by tryna prove my fucking love
I stand up, say "I had enough"
She stand up "Boy you think you tough"
Take my phone, search what you want
"Who's this bitch?" "Girl that's my mom"
"Who's this woman?" "Girl that's my aunt"
I could be a lame nigga, that's what you want?
See you want me to be a pretty liar so bad
But I can't fuck with karma cause she always comes back
So call me every name you can find in the book
But don't try to discredit every chance that I took

[Pre-Hook]
I'm running low so don't play with my time
I'm searching but it's nothing left to find
Send out a call but no one's on the line
So if you want it please make up your mind
Please make up your mind
[Hook]
I don't wanna lose myself loving you (You, you, yeah, yeah)
Loving you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't wanna lose myself loving you (You, you)
(I don't wanna lose myself)
Loving you
(I don't wanna lose myself)

[Outro]
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself

Nonchalant Lyrics[Verse]
Watch your mouth when you lettin' shit slide
Don't you know I got way too much pride?
Sneak dissin' way on the other side
I turn your fucking wave to a tide
I'm so fucking tired, somehow I still find the time
To care a little more about my rhymes
To care a little more about my peers
To think a little less about my fears
To care a little more about your ears
I give a piece of me to everybody I meet
Not because they want it, it's because it's prolly a need
Claim they woke but they probably asleep, in a cage
Thinking if they make a mill they be free like Meek, nah
I turned a nightmare right into a dream, yeah
I keep my sanity, 'cause I ain't on the scene, yeah
I know I gotta be a rock like Dwayne
So, I'm tryna be a rock like Dwayne, Carter Rebirth
Put that line in reverse, add a little reverb, yeah
We work, so my niggas ain't gotta be on T-Shirts
Watch me get my hands dirty with the rework
Damn, do I even have the fans for this shit?
To be rapping like these people understanding this shit
It's demanding and shit, but I stand for these kids
Like they stan for the kid, understand, how we clear
Crack a beer when I'm feelin' pissed, hmm, yeah
But I ain’t got nobody hand up my back, you ventriloquist
Ever since my songs went platinum like Sisqó
Life done found a filter like VSCO, ay
But it's okay, 'cause
If you down and you need a lil' help, it's a way
If you hatin' and you feelin' insecure, Issa Rae
I'm somewhere between humble and hell nah
These niggas drop their second album then fell off
My nonchalant flow will never end right
It be at they necks if it's in sight
Squeezing until they crack a windpipe
Loosen the grip, have a lil' remorse
You dial 9-1-1 I pull up in a Porsche
Word is I'm carrying the torch and I ain't wanna share
So beware if you reach you get scorched
Ever since I jumped off the porch
I knew that I would grow to be the boy
The boy then grew to be the man
Learned how to kill a hook, Peter Pan
I'm tryna make the end stand out
But I'm so fucking outstanding
I'm so fucking outlandish and a opp can't win
Man's not hot
I been on ten, landslide wins, yeah35Embed

Never Know Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I know a lot of people but I don't fuck with a lot
Got me standing here when I just wanna leave the spot
Thinking 'bout a whip, and man, I might just cop the drop
Just so they could think I'm friendly when I'm not
Arm out the window like yessir (Yessir)
Right good, working on my left bruh
Man I got my shit together then I stepped up
I got tired of niggas telling me I'm next up
Old label wasn't talking 'bout nothing
Meanwhile, I'm getting ready for a run
I ain't sitting, I ain't talking, I ain't hustling with you niggas
Fuck around and y'all gon' make me push a button on you niggas, ayy
I got a baby on the way (Baby on the way)
I think about it every day (I think about it every day)
They think that paper gon' change me
I do this shit for my baby
I do this shit for my niggas
And we go way back just like crack in the muhfuckin' 80's
This flow is crazy, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, nigga this flow is crazy
I don't fear no man or no object
Bullfighter, I've been working on my sidestep
I know preparation gets you through the process
Look at all the progress
[Chorus]
I ain't have nobody there, so I had to tell myself when to go (When to go)
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know (Never know)
I ain't have nobody there so I had to tell myself when to go (When to go)
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know, ayy

[Verse 2]
I would never know
Worked on this shit till I was a pro
Ran through these streets, ran through these beats
Ran through these thoughts, ran through these hearts
I was in the dark till I caught a spark
Feel like I'm on fire, get too close, make a nigga die
They cannot be I, it's too hard, they could probably try
They could try, I'm on I-20 tryna get to eighty-five
My girl mad but she don't want another guy
I wonder why?
Wait, uh, no I don't
Work real hard and I get what I want
This is for them days we ain't eat
This is for them nights we ain't sleep
Going through beat after beat now
I could probably make a hundred songs in my sleep
(Yeah-yeah-yeah)

[Chorus]
I ain't have nobody there, so I had to tell myself when to go (When to go)
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know (I would never know)
I ain't have nobody there so I had to tell myself when to go (When to go)
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know (I would never know)
[Outro]
I would never, I would never, I would never, I would never, never know
Yeah-yeah, I would never know35Embed

Switch Lyrics[Verse 1: 6LACK & Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha (ayy)
I'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha
To get away from all the cameras
I'm over it, don't wanna fantasize
Fate is 'round the corner, right (Fate is 'round the corner right)
It hit me right between the eyes (Hit me right between the eyes)
It's funny when they switch and pick a side
Ain't nobody gotta go through what I'm going through, no
But it seems like they all know what I'm supposed to do so
Let's switch bodies for a day
You could me be and I could be you
Juggle the pile of shit that's bound to come through
You can have it since it's automatic

[Chorus: 6LACK & Ty Dolla $ign]
Now switch (switch)
Tell me how it feels (feels)
To be somebody else (else)
Now switch (switch)
It wasn't what you thought it was (was)
Another story to tell
[Post-Chorus: 6LACK]
Well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
“So tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me lies
You and I ride or die, you and I
Entertain these other bitches and I will not
Entertain these other niggas, you know that
If I give you my heart, would you hold that?
Would you put it up safe or would you fold that?
If I find out you cheating me, just know that
I'ma kill you and that ho, ain't no going back”
That's what she told me, and how could I blame her?
A small town girl, now she all famous (switch)
Maybe it's my fault now, ain't like I've been livin' in the dark nah
I told you everything from the start
And you the one that had a change of heart
Girl, you can have it after all the damage

[Chorus: 6LACK & Ty Dolla $ign]
Now switch (switch)
Tell me how it feels (feels)
To be somebody else (else)
Now switch (switch)
It wasn't what you thought it was (was)
Another story to tell
[Post-Chorus: 6LACK]
Well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well

[Outro: 6LACK]
I'm thinking I should speed it up
To get away from all the media
I'm human, don't you think I had enough?
My woman claiming that I switched on her
Only 'cause I hit a switch on her
She wasn't really good at keeping up30Embed

Seasons Lyrics[Verse 1: 6LACK]
It's been a lil' cold
At night outside
Switch out the wardrobe
Gotta be dressed for the ride
Got hit with a winter breeze
And oh, we like to act tough, what we do it for?
Be careful with energy
No need to be so cold, I wanna be more

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Ooh, summer's calling
A beautiful summer's calling
Ooh, summer's calling
(I done had a real long winter)
A beautiful summer's calling
[Verse 2: Khalid]
I've been goin' through, you been through it (You been through it)
I fall back to look at what we're doing (Now)
I can yell at you, but what's the use? (What's the use?)
If you really love me, gotta prove it
I'm carrying this baggage, need to pack light
Hate seein' you sad, I gotta act right
I'm looking forward for the brighter
Oh, my love

[Chorus: 6LACK & Khalid]
Ooh, summer's calling
A beautiful summer's calling
Ooh, summer's calling
(I done had a really long winter)
A beautiful summer's calling

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
Have you ever looked at someone and said, "I could spend my whole life witcha"?
You're lucky the greatest thing I can do is marry you
'Cause if I could, I'd spill my blood
Down to give you my last breath
The old me is on his last stretch
I guess a new season's next (Next)

[Chorus: 6LACK & Khalid]
Ooh, summer's calling
A beautiful summer's calling
Ooh, summer's calling
(I done had a really long winter)
A beautiful summer's calling
[Outro: Mereba]
Miscommunication leads to complication and...
Here we are staring at each other as strangers, sleepin' in the same bed
'Cause it's like, you were never taught how to use your words like that
You were never taught how to say loving things and caring things
You were just taught how to say what had to be said
So, I want the words that you don't have and I'm stuck trying to figure out what you feel
Just think about it, like, what might this life be like if we put our pride to the side and let love lead the way10Embed

Worst Luck Lyrics[Verse 1]
You tell me get away
But you don’t mean that
You tell me leave you alone
But you don’t need that
On my own too
“Honey I don’t need you
Look at how I’ve grown
I'm a big girl
I can do it by myself
All on my own”

[Pre-Chorus]
So why you wanna love me so bad?
Why you wanna love me so bad?
Haven’t you heard about my miserable past
Critical past, pitiful past?
I swear no matter what I touch it breaks
So I no longer wanna see your face (Face, face, face)
[Chorus]
I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
Or maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
I swear I got the worst luck with love
The worst luck with love
Maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
No no, no no
Oh, no

I tell you let it go but you don’t want to
I ask you what the fuck you want
You say "I want you"
Are you crazy
You could have it all
Why settle for me?
You're doing good
You should keep going
Don’t backpedal for me
[Pre-Chorus]
So why you wanna love me so bad?

Critical past, pitiful past?

Ain't hurting enough

Sorry Lyrics[Intro: Tierra Whack]
Nah, but, listen, I'm following my dreams, I'm chasing my, my, my, my dreams, uhm, accomplishing all my goals. I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. And that's, you know, niggas, they always gonna be there

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Really hate saying sorry
Gotta be another way
I know you hurt regardless
Tryna take away the pain
I know I've done some foolish things before
I know that I've been swerving on this course
Checking myself, 'cause I just can't ignore, oh, oh

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Can find me somewhere writing when I’m wrong
Girl, I'm just tryna see if I belong
Mistakes feel like a fracture in my bones
[Post-Chorus: 6LACK]
Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, 'cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
We over the same shit
Swinging for the fence, but somehow I can't hit
You wonder why I came here
Despite a couple kinks, don't no shame hang here
I know I've said some foolish things before
I know that I've been swerving on this course
A lot of shit that you just can't ignore, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Can find me somewhere writing when I’m wrong
Girl, I'm just tryna see if I belong
Mistakes feel like a fracture in my bones
Do all this work only to fuck it up
But I'm not down for quitting on your love
It's twisted but I just can't get enough

[Post-Chorus: 6LACK]
Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, 'cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson
[Bridge: 6LACK]
So I'ma write, when I'm wrong
Haven't I already shown
What it's like to love someone so much
You treat their heart like it was your own

[Post-Chorus: 6LACK]
Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

[Outro: 6LACK]
Rights, wrongs
I'm just tryna s–, oh
Feels like a fracture, bones, oh, oh11Embed

Unfair Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hope my mistakes don't make me less of a man
'Cause lately it feel like them shits really can
I'm prayin' I don't wake up all alone
It's hard to say it, so I write a song
But that ain't equal to me righting wrongs
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
And I might have to figure this out the hard way
We may not end on the best terms
Maybe we should love and we should learn

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fight or be at war
With you, but you
Gotta want the same things
I don't wanna fight or be at war, no, no
With you, but you
Gotta want the same things
[Verse 2]
So if you ever fall
You know that I'll be there
I know how to put my ego aside, yeah
Correct me if I'm wrong
You said you never wanna share
But know I'm stuck between
What I love and who I love and
I know it's unfair8Embed

Alone / EA6 LyricsPart I: Alone

[Intro: Spoken]
I know that but being around, in that atmosphere and seeing how people move, you know, seeing how, how they make records, you know, what kind of record they make... I'm just like... I don't want this shit for myself and I don't ever want niggas to try to pull me into that. 'Cause I've been told a couple times like, "Hey, do this shit man, do that..." And I'm like man, I don't want, I don't want that for me man.
And if I keep tellin' y'all I don't want that shit for me and y'all keep, you know, tryna nudge and push... I understand y'all got your vision and y'all got your formula but that shit don't work for me, man. I'm not gonna conform, like, I'm not settling for that shit. 'Cause if I do it once and it pop, I'ma have to keep doing that shit over and over again. You can't build no fanbase like that! You...you become, you become, you become a fuckin' song instead of a person. That shit...I'm not...I'm not tryna be that man.

[Verse 1]
Mmmmm...migraines from overthinking
I'm tryna let go
Let go of my past, man that shit been tryna creep up, up
Contemplatin' on if I'm really as strong as I thought, bitch I might be
Quick to pull me down but as much as I've seen, I can't fall, it's unlikely
Shit get a little twisted up
I put my troubles in a dirty then I mix it up
I’m bouta change my number
Like I haven’t switched enough
This is home
And you ain't Zone 6 enough
Gone
I’m from East Atlanta Zone
If you ain't from it
Take your ass home
I let my heart talk, keep my mental strong
Speak the whole truth 'til my money long
[Interlude: Spoken]
Half of them don't even know your name. I don't want that, I want people to know who the fuck I am. I want people to know what I stand for. I want people to be personal and know, "This is 6LACK, this is what he believe in...."

[Hook]
What we need to talk about
Get gone, get gone, yea yea
Got the past whispering in my ear
He flaw, she flaw, what’s wrong?
I got troubles, and they won't leave me alone

[Verse 2]
It seems like everybody got something to say
Everybody got a look they tryna get off of their face
Everybody got an opinion
And I don’t want one
Trying to tell me a better way to do some shit
That you ain't ever done
Sips drink in the booth
Black down to my shoes
Kick shit with my troops
Kicking shit, Ryu
You not with the shit why you
Front for those who don’t matter
When they not thinking about you
If I learned anything
It would probably be to listen more than I talk
And don’t brag about what I got
Just multiply what I brought
I never dwell on a loss
Never give a nigga sauce
He might run off with it all, he might run off with it all
He might run off with it all, he might run off with it all
[Hook]
Get gone get gone, yea yea
Got the past whispering in my ear
He flaw, she flaw, what’s wrong?
I got troubles, and they won’t leave me alone
Get gone, get gone
Got the past whispering in my ear
He flaw, she flaw, what’s wrong
I got troubles, and they won’t leave me alone

Part II: EA6

[Interlude: Spoken]
Like I’m more of myself than I’ve ever been
Which is something that you really gotta come to face with sometimes
'cus, I thought I was, you know, fully myself 24/7
But nope, like right now is how I’m supposed to feel all the time
It's how I’m supposed to be all the time
It's how I’m supposed to think all the time
Now I know going out of this, I know leaving this
That will follow me
It doesn’t, you know, end with this, you know
I gotta take it and I, live with it every day
I see the people around me and
I feel so much
I wanna put it in words
Try and figure out where to go with it
But I just feel so much
I know they don’t even feel as much as I feel
But that’s alright
That’s alright
We have two different purposes
Clearly my purpose is some shit that’s way fucking bigger than me
Then it gets completely quiet when I'm at the beach
I know I’m one person but I kinda feel like this ripple effect is gonna impact a lot of people
I feel God talking and when he talks everything else is silent
[Verse 3]
Summer 2011
Almost lost my faith in God
Same time I never prayed so hard
Took control of my life so I wouldn’t have to take no job
Press play I couldn’t take no pause
I’m from east Atlanta 6 they don’t play that shit
In East Atlanta six you better make that lick
Or they be at your front door with that gun doe
Know them niggas Nick Cannon with the fucking drum roll
East side 'till a nigga die
Beast mode 'till a nigga cry
Sensei make a nigga fly
Shit hard but you gotta try
If I can do it, you can do it too
Time to be a better guy
I found the answer ridin' down Candler
I'm late for court 'cause traffic on Moreland
I’m trying to preach to y'all what’s important
So hard for me to ignore ignorance
I don’t know why I feel it’s my place
I know you see the pain in my face
I call the shots and move at my pace
But I understand it's all a big race
I understand you want that big face
They offering and hey
It's hard for me to say
That I wouldn’t bite the bait they threw me
Be cautious where you play
It’s darkness in the A

[Chorus]
Be cautious where you play
It’s darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play
It’s darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play
It’s darkness in the A

[Verse 4]
A-Town stomp on the old me
Used to ride through the hood with the slow creep
People gon' love what they don't need
I remember what the OG's told me
You better shine bright when the lights down
Less talk, more show, nigga pipe down
'Cause words ain't shit but your thoughts out loud
And thoughts are the opposite of showin' nigga's how

[Chorus]
Be cautious where you play, there's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play, there's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play, there's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play, there's darkness in the A12Embed

One Way Lyrics[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Hands 'round my neck
You know I got a lot left
Can't have nobody else getting away
You should get your confirmation today
Usually I don't do no flying out
But I been going through some things on the road yeah
Thinking 'bout that old thing
We still haven't even been to each other's house
But maybe that could wait for another time
I never been one to fuck up the vibe
Though I might fuck up your life

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Take one breath, take two (two)
The other side of you is on the loose
Ain't got much to say
I shoulda copped the one way
Girl, I know you wanna stay, stay, stay
[Bridge: 6LACK]
You might have to catch a plane for this
You gon' have to say my name for this
'Cause usually, I don't do no flying out
But something feel different this time (this time)

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Don't feel no way (no way, no way)
'Less it's from foreplay (foreplay)
You know you wetter than most
Brought you in on first class, that's better than most
Now usually, I don't do no flying out
But to keep it G, it's been a long week and I'm feeling lonely
We still haven't even fucked on each other's couch
Maybe that should wait for another time
I never been one to fuck up the vibe
But I will fuck up your life

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Take one step, take two (two)
The other side of you is on the loose
Ain't got much to say
Shoulda copped the one way
And I know you wanna stay, stay, stay

[Bridge: 6LACK]
You might have to catch a plane for this
You gon' have to say my name for this
'Cause usually, I don't do no flying out
But something feel different this time (this time)
[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Just getting off stage now (When will you be here?)
Cause FaceTime ain't enough face time (Other girls outta fucking kill to be here)
Tell your boss you ain't working tomorrow
And ask 'em why they got my girl working so hard
Now, you gon' make me use up all my miles
Famous niggas get so lonely
And I know you gon' come and put it on me
And I can't wait to put this in your mouth
I should probably go and take care of mine-uh
Text me when you land in South Carolina
Tell the Uber she can take one left, take two
Oh, I don't really know what I'ma do when I see you
I don't really have not much to say
That's why I got the one way
That shit is expensive babe
So I had to put you on the plane for this

[Outro: T-Pain]
You gon' have to say my name for this
'Cause usually, I don't do no flying out
But something feel different this time (this time)
Something feel different this time (this time, this time)15Embed

Disconnect Lyrics[Verse 1: 6LACK]
You think I don't know when to call it quits
How could I not know after all this here?
I spent so much time tryna find a signal but
It’s safe to say it's no good
I think I need to roll up

No, I don't wanna piss you off
No, I ain’t tryna make you yell

Love is not looking over shoulders
Love is you should trust what I told you
Lately it's like you been speaking fantasy and I'm speaking reality
'Cause we got problems we ain’t getting over

And not just on some boyfriend-girlfriend shit
I think we had enough
Like, I can’t hear you
I'm falling out of love

[Chorus: 6LACK]
I’m tryna work it out
But we got a disconnect
I'm tryna work it out

Like, damn, nigga, you can't hold it down for two seconds? Hold your dick down, nigga
I'm holding my pussy down, I'm keeping my pussy to myself - keep your dick to yourself, nigga. That's mine! The fuck? I don't like to share, period!3Embed

Loaded Gun Lyrics[Intro]
My fault, no

[Verse 1]
I got women calling my phone like I owe them somethin'
It's kinda my fault, I guess I showed them somethin'
No shit, I treat my dick like it's a loaded gun
Point that shit away, these hoes gon' blow what comes
No disrespect when I say, if you love me better fuck me
Like you 'bout to lose your place to the girl next door
And hell no, I don't want her, I'm just giving you incentive
Inspiration before I go on these sold out tours
Got this pretty brown-brown, watch her go wild
Found her confidence, so she a pro now
Your man a clone, quick, come down to zone 6
Treat you to hot wings like it's some fancy shit
Hot lemon pepper whip, that mean it's wet as shit
Don't question what I earn, I put that on my wrist (wrist)
Wait until a nigga get home, listen, nigga got the shit on
But I'm going for they spouses
I can pull 'em with the flip phone (brr)
[Chorus]
Time, all I’m ever asking for is time
I just needed time to clear my mind
What I want is already mine
Needed a little time
All I’m ever asking for is time
I just needed time to clear my mind
What I want is already mine

[Verse 2]
I got people I don't know expecting something from me
Could let it throw me off but, man, it's nothin' to me
"More money, more problems," that ain't no lie, I swear
Say I'ma take a break, but that's the only lie I tell
We made it past ten-thousand hours, lot of power
Now I'm fully loaded, fresh off Moreland Ave
Now I'm in my bag, ain't no cap
Eastside on my back, daughter on my back
She a Kirkwood baby, puttin' in work little baby, uh
This is a message for y'all (y'all)
Making my way through the fall (fall)
Loaded, we came for it all (all)
You only came here to ball (ball)
Don't shit happen by chance over here
I pray to God and then I conquer my fears
Since then I done took care of my fam'
Took care of myself, took care of my health
And that ain't no 360, that's a 180
I got one baby, that's one lady I'ma answer to
She be the reason I'm righting my wrongs and shit
Love is the reason I'm writing these songs and shit
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah8Embed
