Life Is Good Lyrics[Part I]

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

[Verse: Drake]
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit
[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)

Where Ya At Lyrics[Intro: Future]
I don't wanna hear all that, I don't wanna hear none of that
Talkin' commas, how much you need and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?
[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 2: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion
[Verse 3: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was "What's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders
[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 4: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Outro: Future]
Where you ass was at, when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest

Comin Out Strong Lyrics[Intro]
High Klassified な音楽
I got the jewels flooded from Ben, baby!

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man, you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh, yeah
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness

Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out..

[Verse 2: Future]
I might end up with your ho if I take one (Still comin')
Now days if they don't have a story, they gon' make one (Still comin')
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one (Still comin')
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one (Still comin')
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones (Yeah, comin')
'Cause now days if they don't got it they'll make one (Still comin')
The only time I feel alive when I take (Still comin')
I wanna vent but I know it ain't safe (Still comin')
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am? (Do you know who I am?)
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (Never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? (Give you my t-)
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (No videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (I invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong (Yeah, comin')

Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too (Keep comin')

Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
I pour champagne on the ground
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (He was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (Gave you chances)
I call for loyalty, she didn't ever answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (La familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies
(So familiar)
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong (Be honest to me)
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong

Codeine Crazy Lyrics[Intro]
Codeine crazy

Pourin' bubbly, pourin' bubbly
Pour that bubbly, pour that bubbly
Pour that bubbly
We done went through too much, you hear me?
(8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)

[Refrain]
Pour that bubbly
Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it
Yeah, I'm covered in it
I was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit
That's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches
That ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
I'm drinking bubbly
I'm drinking bubbly (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
Take all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model, yeah
Audemars, this not a carnival, this is a Royal Oak Cartier
Dom Perignon, I get down from a brown, I get chauffeured around
I pour up with my rounds, I pour up out of town
I corrupted your town with them guns and them pounds
I grew up on the grounds with them dealers and hounds
We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass 'em around
I say everything triple time
Rollie, AP, Hublot, triple time
I just know the ones you call upon
I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat
Every time a nigga talk, a check
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette
Run it back, you hear my intellect (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)

[Bridge]
Celebrating like the championship
Celebrating like the championship
Celebrate like the championship
Celebrate like the championship
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you
Hahah, celebrate

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me you celibate to the mula
I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
I just went St. Tropez-in' like a goonie
Abu Dhabi, nigga straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson, put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick, it got my brain washed
And for that shit, you got your man popped
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil', lil' liquor out, pour a lil' more liquor out
Pour it out, pour it out, pour it out
[Chorus]
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy

[Verse 3]
Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene, it's homicide
Diamond pinky ring a lollipop
Fuck the hate, I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin' harder than the Pacers
I been tryin' to have some patience
Told my mama she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gon' put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I'm making USD's overseas
That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Fuck that white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Playin' poker, now we're back in Stroker
I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control it
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles, these niggas too bogus
Let's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint like I'm Kid Cudi, probably
I fuck around, faint, I'ma fall on the drank
Rockin' Tom Ford, poppin' mollies
Married to this motherfuckin' money
[Chorus]
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy

[Verse 4]
You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo
I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might get after Madonna
I get it crack in the summer
Strapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partner
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
Don't you panic, panoramic companion
They was tryna serve me at the arraignment
Never comment on it, never complaining
I'm taking everything that come with these millions
I'm taking everything that come with my children
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
Pour that bubbly
Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it
Yeah, I'm covered in it
I was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit
That's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches
That ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely

Thought It Was a Drought Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, Wizard
Dirty soda, Spike Lee
White girl, Ice T
Fully loaded AP, yeah

[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ayy
[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 2]
I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, "Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout"
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air
[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Outro]
Thought it was a drought, thought it, thought it was a drought
We thought it was a drought, we poured an Actavis
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you

I Won Lyrics[Produced by Metro Boomin]

[Chorus: Future]
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
I won, I won, I won a trophy
I just want to take you out and show you off

Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy

[Verse 1: Future]
Get to fuckin' on the dresser just to make that pussy wetter
Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin' Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you, only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them 12 foot ceilings, I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you
I want to live my dream with you
You say that money don't matter it's the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me, got you in custody
Whoever knockin' at the door, they gotta wait 'til we finished
I know I started at the bottom but that ain't where we endin'

[Chorus: Future]
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
I won, I won, I won a trophy
I won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
A trophy
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You the number one trophy wife
So it's only right to live the trophy life
You grew up on J. Lo, Timberlands by Manolo now
'Til one day I put an angel in your ultrasound
I wanna dip that ass in gold, I wanna dip that ass in gold
I made it over NBA, NFL players
So every time I score it's like the Super Bowl
Baby, we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies, right?
[Chorus: Future]
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
I won, I won, I won a trophy
I won me a trophy

Well, then tell me who deserve it
Eyes getting low but I'm still observing, I see you lurking
Never see me out in person, I'm always working
Money on your head if you make a nigga nervous
Never made a move out here unless I was certain
Tatted on me, but this shit is deeper than the surface
I'm with everyone that I was here with in the first place
Making sure that they all good before they close the curtain

Weighed 1008 grams on the scale
I got a lower case T across my chest
Your crack house doin' numbers then you blessed
You move your momma to a crib from the 'jects
It's so much alcohol and kush on my breath
We prayin' five times a day to catch a plug
A few bean pies stashed in the trunk
Shoot dice all day and sell dust
You loaded up, they talkin' shit, you gone bust
Told yourself a million times, you don't give a fuck
Sold over a million dimes, hangin' in the cut
Sold over a million dimes, I don't give a fuck

We on the turf, getting active on the backstreet
I'm drinkin' Actavis, the only thing that relax me
I'm on drugs, every single day I pop a seal
We talk that lingo 'round here, we try to work a deal
You pull up round here, they serve you here to Dixie Hills
You hit Old Nat, I know on Godby you’ll see a trap house
Gotta cock it back, out here this shit wid-ild

Snatch it, then hide it from the 12
Movin' them squares and them bales
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood

Get it, nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face

And flood their Rollie till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues
The J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From 16 years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies

She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes

And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea, niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though
Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho

Young nigga 'bout to smash out

Stick Talk Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

[Chorus]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery
[Verse 1]
They came through with a stick and you heard it
They came through in this bitch and they were swerving
I can't believe the blood ain't on my shirt
Because he got hit close-range
We be talking stick talk, we be talking bricks too
We be talking lick talk, and I'ma fuck your bitch too
I ain't got no manners for no sluts
I'ma put my thumb in her butt

[Pre-Chorus]
Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Verse 2]
I'ma tell a lie under oath
I can see it in your eyes, you're going broke
Oxycontin got her with a body count (sak pase)
Riding in a car I barely can pronounce
Ordered up a chauffeur, told him, "ride me round the whole world"
I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Hit it little harder, get the Benz
[Chorus]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Bridge]
Fully loaded whip tote fully loaded clips
Fucking with my niggas, I'll smoke a zip
Red eyes, and I got them Zoes with me
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Pre-Chorus]
Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

[Chorus]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk58Embed

Mask Off (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Future]
Call it how it is
Hendrix
I promise, I swear, I swear
If Young Metro don't trust you, I’m gon' shoot you
You heard, spit it, yo

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches
[Verse 1: Future]
Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on a coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, thirty-three chains
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, that’s a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, Molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I got a halo
I level up every time God say so
Shooter on payroll
Lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan
Ten dividends gon' grow when I say "grow"
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch
Ain't no penny that I don't touch
All my enemy bite on dust
Ain't no talkin' when it's fatal
Havin' heart, I can't tell (Wait)
Half of y'all might need help (Wait)
I might fall in Rodeo (Bitch)
I might ball in Australia (Say no more)
I might call her for real (Say no more)
All the ass gon' unveil
Wind blows in the windows and I snuck in when the vent close
She copy like 10-4, know who we sent for
Platinum, platinum, platinum
Gotta look at self and ask what happened
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a Create-A-Player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean, I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions and put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin', it's deep (It's deep)
I done fucked so much, I can't sleep
I done fucked so much, I'm retired (Swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Dave Free (Swear to God)
She said she broke down when Prince died (It's alright)
Bitch, my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince)
Get your ass up and be inspired (Get inspired)
You know how many bodies in the street? (How many?)
Take the mask off so you can see
[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Outro: Future]
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off
Vengeance is mine, said the Lord91Embed

They couldn't be here, you hear me?
They gotta be somewhere else

I ain't worryin' 'bout no fucking, I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to you?
My love don't mean that much to you
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope when you fucking on that nigga, when you finished
He can say that he love you
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words, I'ma ball without you
I came home last night to a ménage
Got my dick sucked and I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you fucking on that nigga, hope you thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga, hope you thinking about me
'Cause I'm thinking about you

I want you to fuck him in paradise
'Cause I wanna be in your head tonight
If loving me in public ain't safe
You can take my love and hide it
Don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love
I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You goin' out the country
You posting up on IG
I'm laid up with my sidepiece
The one that text while you was right there laying up beside me
Now tell me you don't want me
Tell me that the pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me you moving on and you don't love me no more
Monster

I ain't worryin' 'bout no fucking, I ain't worried 'bout no fucking

Jersey Lyrics[Chorus]
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo, extendo, extendo
The clip gotta hold like a thirty
I got my clique and they represent this
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys

I get love way in Jersey
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy

Couple commas, made a purchase

You do what you want once you cop it
You do what you want when you got it, yeah
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you got it, huh

I be on syrup, they know it, huh
Stack up some money, then blow it, huh
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the Styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code, but that ain't for us

[Verse 1]
Do what you want when you poppin', don't fold up
When I'm feelin' the stress, then I pour up
Reppin' the set like a soldier
Hop out a Benz when I roll up
I wasn't splurging on purpose
You lame niggas makin' me nervous
I keep me a banger like Birdie
Sip out my cup and it's dirty

Bitch, you know a nigga poppin', wait your turn
I make so much money, it's got me delirious
When your gang-gang in the chain gang, shit serious
I gotta maintain, I'm superior, nigga
I rep the same gang on account of my niggas
We fill up two planes on account of these riches
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches

Stack up some money, then blow it, huh

Selfish Lyrics[Intro: Rihanna & Future]
Ooh (Ooh)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Rihanna with Future]
It was right
Even though it felt wrong
Nothin' ever stopped you
From showin' your progression suddenly
Broken lies
Driving backwards
Making all the wrong turns, saying all the wrong words
Dodging angels

[Refrain: Future & Rihanna]
Oh-oh
Let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Let's be one
Oh-oh
Let's not be alone

Breathe for me and I'll breathe for you

I just hit the lick, south of France
Currency exchange, lookin' fancy
If that money dirty, make it dance
25 karats cost a mansion
Gold rose petals, bottle standin'
Came from the concrete, takin' chances
Pop gold Ace like a Xanny
I just need the blessin' from your family
Broken lies, ain't no love without us
It will die, roses turn into dust
Every night, we gettin' more popular
Wrong is right when it comes to us

Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone, mmm, tonight

[Verse 1]
And I keep a pint of cup of purple like Whoopi
And I keep the stainless steel on me like shoes
They got me going way harder now we can't lose
I had the conversation cause these niggas ain't true
I know you credit card fraud gangs bustin' some moves
I hope you're stacking money to the ceiling out the roof
I hope you ain't catchin' feelings for no bitch who fucked the crew
You know I'm independent, get the 'rillo, bust a jug
You know that purple reign had them hitters on foot
I see you acting strange, I can tell this ain't love
That brand new Mulsanne, had to get it out the mud
Purple reign, purple reign is understood

[Chorus 2]
Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-

[Verse 2]
I just need my girl, I just need my girlfriend
I bought a couple Hublots like I'm pushing heroin
I bought a couple coupés, I bought a couple Panameras
I'm acting like a Freeband Gang terrorist
Red cup of lean, don't approach me like a junkie
Take a pledge to the team, we gon' kill and get money
International, we taking over all the countries
Any nationality they coming, baby, coming
Ride shotgun in the foreign, that's a Rover
Until you gun down, we gon' never have closure
Got real estate downtown, investing all over
I heard you're trying to talk down like I ain't focused
I know you tryna play around like I ain't got soldiers
Big cup of syrup washing down all my doja
Wearing Louis loafers like they old penny loafers
Started off local, got the cribs bi-coastal
I don't want no words with you 'cause you mad bogus
I'm just tryna motivate the hoods all over
I'm just tryna teach you how to get these whips loaded
I'm just tryna show you how to get a few Rollies
[Chorus 1]
Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-
Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend

[Verse 3]
Hope I didn't come at you the wrong way, that wasn't planned
Hope you see the path that I made, I took a chance
I just put my passion and drive into this
Two cups of that dirty, take a dab, blow kush and
We ain't gonna talk about it, cut you off if you keep pushing
Since I got the fame, can't forget I was crooked
They wanna see me make the wrong move, bite the bullet
See me whip up in that new school just like a bullet

[Chorus 2]
Purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-
Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple-
Purple reign, purple reign

Yacht cruisin' in the deep
I'm twisted up, I got geeked
Misbehaving with your freak
Can't tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the 6
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got Firm niggas, Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn
Downtown Atlanta I was born30Embed
