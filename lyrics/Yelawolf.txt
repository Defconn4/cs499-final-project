Best Friend Lyrics[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say, boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say, boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah
[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin' in
But if you spit on my fuckin' grave
And wish me Hell, then I wish you well
I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah
[Verse 3: Eminem & Yelawolf]
God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my
Beefs, and things seem
To be looking decent recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter the priesthood
But at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked, so I might say something back
That might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or what I have to
Say on the mic, then you might wanna act just
Like quarterbacks and take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause
I'm a sinner, and I, I got a best friend, best friend
Plus balls and intestines, and they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up the minute I'm ever givin' it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin'
'Cause failure's somethin' I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nuttin', you ain't my best friend, best friend
Who you think I'm talkin' 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a best friend, best friend
Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power, now
When I blackout, power outage—oww
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I'll be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you—blaow
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option
Somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my best friend
[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah710Embed

Till It’s Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on now
I’m not the shoulder for a bag, don't wanna carry your heavy load
I'm not the road that you take when you're lookin' for a shortcut, uh
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch
I ain't the money man, with your money man, you ain't lookin' at me
I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free
I ain't the dishrag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out
Ain't got no check for 'em, if you checkin' in
Mothafucka check this out

[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, but what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
[Verse 2]
I'm not the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
I'm not the new kid, on the block
That you can just follow and push around
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Not the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
'Cause I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
That you scheming to check out
Unless you're looking to check out [shot, shot, shot]
What a mess now (c'mon)

[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
[Verse 3]
I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around and tellin' me I changed
Damn right I fuckin' changed
When this fuckin' change in my pocket
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
I went from shoppin' without nothin'
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin'
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say "I'm a fan"
Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it

[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone136Embed

American You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Man, you got it all worked out
Don't you? Old pair of shoes
Never wear your heart on your sleeve
Cause it don't go with the suit
You got a bad, bad woman with a young little pretty face
They told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway

[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

[Verse 2]
Mama said steer clear of the devil
So you never played in the road
Always lookin' on the bright side
So you never see the potholes
You got a house on a hill
Big news, that's a big deal
Big party with your big time friends
Man, imagine how that feels
[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

[Verse 3]
I believe in the modest dream, ain't lookin' for a pot of gold
A 6 pack and some good marijuana, I can watch my mama roll
I believe I could buy a few things like a house with a nice pool
Invite my nobody friends to the party and we’ll pee in it, fuck you

[Verse 4]
You got a blue-collar father who drinks Budweiser out the bottle
20 dollars, an old Impala, a baby's mama
You work hard, you don't beg, you don't borrow
Night at the factory, daytime job at McDonald's
Your daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem
But you fell in love 'cause to you she was like a supermodel
And they told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway
It ain't no problem
You make somethin' out of nothin', you make money for a livin'
Pushin' buttons, diggin' ditches, flippin' burgers in the kitchen
With the vision, you've been dreamin', you've been savin'
You've been given nothin' but shit
But you take it cause you're patient in this prison
Fuck everybody dissin', it ain't them who gotta live in this skin
With all these tattoos that you got that fuckin' offends them
If it's you that I'm speakin' to, you must be my extension
I take my drink up and sip it, take my hat off and tip it
Slumerican
[Chorus]
Oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too93Embed

Catfish Billy Lyrics[Intro]
I've got a lot of things to do
Like what?
Doesn't matter, I don't want Pa to skin me alive like he's gonna do to you if he finds out
Pa said not to bother him. And if he's not gonna be home, how can I bother him?
It'd be better if you just forget about it
Well I'm going to do it, and I'm gonna take Jack with me, cause Pa didn't say anything to him

[Pre-Verse]
Way down this country road in a holler
Where they make that moonshine still
There's an old man on the porch on a shack
And the shack is where he lives
Round the town they call him Pa
It's Pa from on the hill
And every time Pa does slay a hog
You can hear that hoggy squeal
[Verse 1]
I’m from the belly of the Bible Belt
That motherfuckin' preacher daughter's son
Where you can't find no woman, no man
No cousin, no friend without a gun
Alabama, that is my home
But the trailer park has got my heart
Off in the hood, I'm at home
When I play in the woods after dark
You won't find me sober much
Always got the bottle of Jacky O
I take my sips, I talk my shit
And I fight anybody that wants to go
Tall and slim, walk with a limp
Cause my nuts are oversized
Fuck your dope and your alcohol
Because your shit is overpriced
Hit the bootleg for 24 before I'm 21, math'matics
Going to jail cause I'm drunk at Piggly Wiggly, (dagnabbit)
Cause I be here and I do my time
Cause I can't make bail on minimum wage
Nothing to do in the country but get drunk
And watch that pendulum sway
Back in the saddle again
Throw my middle finger up to the law
I ain't gotta rob nobody tonight
But I might do it just because
I'm a nut, I get bored
Did some pills, but I want more
Fuck this world, fuck this town
If I fuck you once, I fuck you sore
Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit, goddamn
Pussy cunt, bitch suck a cock
If you want some of this rock-and-roll
Take this pipe, suck this rock
Where's the fire, Super-Hot
Clean em' up, grab a mop
Catfish on my shit
Fuck with me, you gonna get dropped
[Hook]
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy, yea, yea
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy, yea, yea
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy, yea, yea
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy

[Verse 2]
You don't want it with me, motherfucker
I promise I'll put you with the piranhas
Inside of a shallow swamp
And then make you follow a boat full of drinking-water
And sing to you lullabies
While I sip on Coronas under umbrellas
Got a propeller
Sharp enough to eat through a two-footed root of a tree
If it's under me, then it's cool
I keep movin'
So why do you think a fuckin' hater
Would lay a log in front of my boat
And put a stop to what I do? Buddy, whatever
When I get up in the morning I think about
When it's all over they can put my body up in the river
With everything I did for the culture inside of a book
And light a candle for my mama
Who got sick from the fucking fame
Immediately
Media will follow me to the end of the river
While the people around my body deliver
Rhythms and syllables relevant of my scripture
I'm a sick son of a bitch, do you get the picture?
[Interlude]
My fucking name is
Catfish
Really, though...

[Hook]
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy, yea, yea
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy, yea, yea
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy, yea, yea

Pop the Trunk Lyrics[Verse 1]
Meth lab in the back
And the crack smoke peels through the streets
Like an early-morning fog
Momma's in the slaughterhouse with the hatchet
Helping Daddy chop early-morning hog
I'm catching Zs like an early-morning saw
When I woke up to the racket, yawn and pause
What the fuck, man? I can never get sleep, man
Peeped out the window, what's wrong with y'all?
Stood up in my Crimson Tide Alabama sweatpants
And threw my pillow
Looks like Daddy caught the motherfucker
That tried to sneak in and steal his elbows
They don't know that old man don't hold hands or throw hands
Nah, he's rough like a Brillo
Went to the Chevy and pulled out a machete
And a gun as heavy and tall as that midget, Willow
[Hook]
Think he's playin'?
You better listen what he's sayin', punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
He got an old Mossberg
In the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
Think he's playin'?
You better listen what he's sayin', punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
He got an old Mossberg
In the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you

[Verse 2]
11:30, and I'm pulling up dirty
Smoking babbage out the back of my buddy's Monte Carlo
Spitting over some Supa Hot Beats
With a super hot freak we call "the parking lot ho"
You know we sipping on that old brown bottle
Bass in the trunk make the whole town wobble
So when we ride around, bitches follow
And tonight, one of them bitches is giving us problems
Well, one of them bitches
Been fucking one of my homeboy's favorite bitches
And he's been on his hit list for a minute
And I think he's ready to handle his business
He told me "Yelawolf, get this"
And he handed me the Cartier watch that was on his wrist
He said "Watch this shit"
And he jumped to the trunk and grabbed his biscuit, biscuit
[Hook]
Think he's playin'?
You better listen what he's sayin', punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
He got an old Mossberg
In the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
Think he's playin'?
You better listen what he's sayin', punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
He got an old Mossberg
In the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you

[Verse 3]
Two men stand
One's gotta go
One falls down to the ground
One walks down to the road
Momma better call the police
Now he's screaming, "No!"
Took a buckshot to the chest
With a rock-salt shell, and he's moving slow
All this blood has spilled
Enough to give a penguin chills
Hot enough to make a potato smoke
At the tip of the hollowed steel
In the valley of the hollowed field
In the valley of the hollowed tip
This ain't a figment of my imagination, buddy
This is where I live! Bama!
[Hook]
Think he's playin'?
You better listen what he's sayin', punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
He got an old Mossberg
In the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
Think he's playin'?
You better listen what he's sayin', punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
He got an old Mossberg
In the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk

Tennessee Love Lyrics[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I must be Jim Morrison to get a motherfucking girl like you
Don’t know what I did in my past life, but it must have been something cool
Cause I’m a whiskey drinking, fight provoking, cigarette smoking dude
I got a problem with my attitude, it’s hard for me to keep cool
But when I look at you, I see me, a reflection of a real soul
So, pardon me if I may seem loose and out of control
It ain’t the drink talking, it’s me talking; fuck if everyone knows
You my girl and that’s that, so hop on the back of this bike and roll
Let’s roll now

[Hook: Yelawolf]
I’d never let someone straight up disrespect you
I’d never let someone call you out your name
I’ll always be the one that runs up to protect you
‘Cause I know if I was down, you’d come and do the same
So let’s pack it up and move our life to Nashville
Build a studio in the house and do our thing
And I’ll take you out and we’ll go honky tonkin’
Get drunk and fall in Tennessee Love
Tennessee Love
Fall in Tennessee Love
Fall in Tennessee Love
Fall in Tennessee Love
[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Can’t you see that my hands are shaking?
Withdrawals from alcohol Ain’t no use in us fakin'
But it’s our life, ain’t it baby? So ain’t no use in us takin'
A chance with it, so I promise that I’ll work on my patience
Someday, if we get lucky and we grow and get old
We’ll look back, and laugh about the circus and the show
But for now, we live it up, we spend it up, and we go
To the last call in every bar in this town turn the lights on and close
You and me now

[Hook: Yelawolf]
I’d never let someone straight up disrespect you
I’d never let someone call you out your name
I’ll always be the one that runs up to protect you
‘Cause I know if I was down you’d come and do the same
So let’s pack it up and move our life to Nashville
Build a studio in the house and do our thing
And I’ll take you out and we’ll go honky tonkin’
Get drunk and fall in Tennessee Love
Tennessee Love
Fall in Tennessee Love
Fall in Tennessee Love
Fall in Tennessee Love

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
When I first met you I was so broke
And I tried to hide behind the Alabama pines, prayin’ that you didn’t know
About my problems, ‘cause I couldn’t bear to see you go
And when you found out all that happened, your little heart was broke
And I had to earn it back and I learned in fact
That money don’t fix that shit
Not tattoos and I love you’s
It’s trust that I had to get
I’m sorry that I ever hurt you
For anything that I did
Can I put this ring on your finger
Let you know that I’m serious?
Marry me now
[Hook: Yelawolf]
I’d never let someone straight up disrespect you
I’d never let someone call you out your name
I’ll always be the one that runs up to protect you
‘Cause I know if I was down, you’d come and do the same
So let’s pack it up and move our life to Nashville
Build a studio in the house and do our thing
And I’ll take you out and we’ll go honky tonkin’

Let’s Roll Lyrics[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

[Verse 1]
Yeah now let me welcome you to my small town
Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall, country folks all around
How I was raised
808 drums quaking, they shake that box, '88
And the dope boys hotter than hells gate
But I, still in the shade
With a fold out chair, with a thirty pack on the back of that tailgate
A-L-A, B-A-M-A
I’m off I might be in the lake
I might go to Talladega and see me a race
And bring me a case
Yeah I’m bringing the case
I’m getting throwed off
[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

[Verse 2]
And I’m all the way throwed off
Z71 take the bow off
Dipped in mossy oak with a mullet mohawk
Yeah with a bright orange hat and a bag underneath that Chevy seat
Yeah buddy, might go off
Split you like a bowling ball
Spit chew in my overalls
Yeah home of the gumbo
Got a couple folks that’d do it to you for the hundo
And when them elephant feet rumble
That dixie cup's gonna fall off the console
You don’t wanna have a convo with not understand that Bama slanguage
Like hollering ain't it
But I come to paint it, so it won’t be throwed off

[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll
[Verse 3]
I’m just a Kid that Rocks
I’m just a boy with a dream
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks
Used to keep a .22 in a shoebox
Now I bang Beretta
She’s twenty-two and I keep her in a tube top
White trash and all
Take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off
Like how the fuck did I get a catalogue with more hits than a fucking jackhammer dog
Cause I planned it all
Crimson Tide standing tall
Shit, I’m another lit cannon ball
Fuck around and I’m going off and I’m getting throwed off

[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off

Bloody Sunday Freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
Yelawolf
Catfish Billy
M.W.A., Ghetto Cowboy, motherfucker
Brian Jones

[Verse]
Yeah, never had to walk away from anybody
Always been about it from the jump
Yeah, never been a hater, never gave a fuck about a hater
Never been a punk
Yeah, been an innovator, fuck a imitator
Drop another hot potato, son
Take 'em back to Piedmont Park
With Baby D and the Kings of Crunk
Rest in peace Grip Plyaz, Speakerfoxxx, and Lenny's Bar
Rest in peace Zoo, you ain't dead but to me you are
Still Dixie Mafia bitch, still wavin' that flag, I'm
New South in everything I drop, whether I sing or rap, ask Dax
Suit up, you gonna need a hazmat
Leavin' these fuckers chewed up
Like a muskrat in a backpack
I'll hang up the Ku Klux and I ain't got to act black
I'll crack a cracker like I crack a plastic bag of Cracker Jacks
Pull up your bra, quit spillin' your guts
You better cork your bottle
You feelin' yourself, like jerkin' off to my tunes
You willin' to bet, I'll make a splash like potholes
After it rains, with your name just like a snot nose
You'll be runnin', tryin' to escape what's comin'
But the exit's blocked, you're fucked, oh to be a woman
There's only one Michael Wayne, there's only one Klever
As for the other white boy from Gadsden, psh, whatever
You're welcome, now take that petty diss and run with it
Fuck around and I'll surround you like circumferences
You build a house of hate around what I have brung to this
Game, I'll make that place your home
Like the Sons of Mumford did
Lame, I'm all the way up, woke, turnt
You think you flame, you all the way suck, choke, burnt
Bitch I'm on fire like holiday nuts, holdin' firm
You want the doe, I'm all the way buck, you'll learn
Hop in the backseat bitch, hip-hop is snoozin'
You could use an Uber, like a student pupil
I'm a teacher, reach ya hand for the ruler, I'ma bruise your ego
Abuse and move into the hall, against the wall, stupid
Who's the man? Who's the tutor?
Lead is flyin' 'til they dead or cryin'
The police are saying now, "Who's the shooter?"
Here I go, with a trench coat and a black rifle
Ten toes down up like a light pole
Middle finger up like a black rhino's horn
I was born for the storm, I'm at home in a shit cyclone
Never let bygones be bygones
Rather I'll say, "See ya later, adios," bitch
Rappin' obese is just bygone
Never thought the culture that I loved would be this sleazy
These videos all look alike, no wonder they can't see me
Is this the guy that said he was the hottest white boy
Since the one with dyed blonde hair? What the fuck?
Hold up, G—easy
I can't let this Tom Cruise-lookin' motherfucker just paddle by
Don't know if I'm watchin' Vanilla Ice or Vanilla Sky
Marshall Mathers may have ignored you
But if you want the smoke, bring the foil
I'll boil you 'til the kettle's dry
Have a nice day, suave
I'm a different breed, I'm a wolf, okay?
Got so many styles I could be a wardrobe, boy
So little boy flows some O.J. poured in the glass
With your buttermilk pancakes
Mama's little helper, Daddy's little bae
Put the Bébé Kids in my Chevrolet
Brought the pepper spray and a banana for AKs
Bitch, holler, "Mayday, mayday"
Then take it to the bank, it's another payday
Oh, you a baller? Well, take the ball and
Let me here kick that shit, Pelé
The nerve of the shit they say, I'm permanently amazed
And your whiskey sucks, fuckin' one sip
I wanted to go straight back to AA
Who else? I would diss Post Malone but he don't even rap
Fuck it, fuck Post Malone, just because
Let's see if he answers back
All that chain stitchin' from Chill Bill
And the cowboy boots and hats
Damn, Posty, can't we be friends?
Our clothes already match
Poser, biter, appropriation thief
Give a fuck how many records you sold
Every fan you made is a leaf off of my tree
Boy, you're my seed
Another mullet in the gang with the teeth icy
I just picked a bone with Post Malone
And did it all on a B-side beat
Dribble through the middle up
Crossover on 'em like I'm in the NBA
Look, I don't really give a fuck
Tell me, what do I gotta lose anyway?
Still mobbin' in the pickup
Throw a middle finger out the window when I wave
Trunk Muzik III, bruh, you gon' know how I feel about MGK
Beethoven is rollin' over in his grave
'Cause I'm a conductor and a conduit
Of musical energy, electrical wave
Prodigy of an anomaly, Shady
Bumpin' daily somethin' crazy, someone save me
Nothing made me somethin', baby
No one's playin', fuck you, pay me

Daylight Lyrics[Intro]
Daylight, woah daylight
Daylight, is coming again
Whiskey, woah whiskey
Whiskey, my only friend

[Verse 1]
Got me a bottle, lookin' out at my El Dorado
Smokin' a barro, whip up an egg and avocado
I'm on the porch like a slummy Ralph Lauren model
Flannel shirt like a lumberjack choppin' a log-o
Pistol next to the ashtray, no bow and arrow
Got blah blah though, knock the beef outcha top nacho
I'm livin' life like there is a tomorrow
I'm slow motion, I'm slow cookin'
The crock pot holds potatoes
I smell the storm comin', I like watching a sorrow
I like watching that muddy water fillin' up the potholes
I like hearing the woods cry, moan, whisper and sing songs
So I can think long; an aficionado
Raindrops on the string hit: a pizzicato
I'm free-fallin', the airplane pilot's on idle
Freezer lookin' like I hit the lotto
And I got beer colder than a Colorado hollow
Do you follow?
[Hook]
And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
When the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded

[Verse 2]
Drinkin' 'til I'm heavily faded
All the sudden the suds I'm sippin' got me feelin' edumacated
I complicate the uncomplicated
My drinkin' partners are the greatest
Me and my buddy, Jack Davis
Daniels, whatever, we Jimmy Beamin', if we get lucky, maybe
We get a visit from the baby King 13 and go fuckin' crazy
Ten racks for a crystal chandelier full of liquid swazy
Now Patsy Cline got me walkin' after midnight
I'm tippin' the neck, gotta make sure to keep the lid tight
Was sittin' up with attention and now I just sit like
Slump down in my chair like a pimp, pondering this life
I'm the great grandson of Otis Williams
Part of me's Cherokee, the other part is a pilgrim
So me and firewater's like splittin' me up the middle
One's tryin' to love him, the other one's tryin' to kill a man
[Hook]
And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
When the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded

[Outro]
Daylight, woah daylight
Daylight, is coming again
Whiskey, woah whiskey
Whiskey, my only friend14Embed

Row Your Boat LyricsYou said you don’t wanna die but still you want to go to heaven
Heaven’s not a place that you can scare me into changing everything that I believe in
Leavin’ what is keeping you from walkin’ out the door and livin’ life like there’s a reason
Reason is the fear of change will leave a person locked inside a dark and mental prison
Prisoners of war, the war is media, they feed to you graffiti up your vision
Visionary super scary future they will shoot ya’ they will loot ya’ they are killin’
Killin’ power of the power that exists above us is a problem - it’s a sentence
Sentence you to pull and push and jump, when they say jump you say how high
There is no limit
Limit what they sell and what they’re givin’

Even if the whole world knows
I don’t give a damn about what they think
I don’t have to stand up to your gun
I don’t have to sit down when you say
Tell me I’m overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there’s any room left on that ship
You don’t have to save any room for me
Cause I’ve got my own boat (even when it rains)
I’m doing my own thing (even when it rains)
And I will stay afloat - even when it rains
Cause i’ve got my own boat
Row, row your boat
Row, row your boat
Row your boat
They marchin’ up the street they wanna fight they don’t want peace
Peace of what you have they snatch and grab
They steal and run
They pullin’ guns out on police
Police they shoot and kill - they shoot at will
They will at you - they’ll execute if you don’t leave
Leavin’ the impression no one’s safe inside this dungeon in the city of the beast
Beasts are on the corner, slingin’ poison to the junkies - to a junkie it’s a feast
Feast or famine, come examine, take a look into that alleyway that’s on your street
Streets are not the only place that you can find yourself laying up under white sheets
Sheets in Alabama cockin’ hammers, ridin’ horses, wanna handle who is free
Free yourself from anything they preach

Even if the whole world knows
I don’t give a damn about what they think
I don’t have to stand up to your gun
I don’t have to sit down when you say
Tell me I’m overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there’s any room left on that ship
You don’t have to save any room for me
Cause I’ve got my own boat (even when it rains)
I’m doing my own thing (even when it rains)
And I will stay afloat - even when it rains
Cause i’ve got my own boat
Row, row your boat
Row, row your boat
Row your boat27Embed

Empty Bottles Lyrics[Hook]
Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger, can I call you a friend?
My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground

[Verse 1]
Brown bottle sits with the permanent bliss
Razor sharp glass lips, give me a kiss
Eyes fixated with a familiar shape
Black label, white letters, they integrate
Cupid's in the bar room with harpoons
I bloom in the night fog like mushrooms
See every bullet hole in the window of my past
Now that's what I call a shot glass (2, 3, 4)
[Hook]
Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger, can I call you a friend?
My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground

[Verse 2]
Count the cracks on the sidewalk
Pack the cigarette box in my left palm
Flame to the tip of a smoke
I don't know where the light came from
Legs like a ghost, I still walk
Whole world mushed concrete, feels soft
Blinded by the cameras pop flash
I'm a big fan, shot glass? (2, 3, 4)

[Hook]
Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger, can I call you a friend?
My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
[Verse 3]
Oh, what a life it's been
What about my life and then?
What about the what and whens?
If's, maybe's, could-have-been's?
You didn't know shit about me, man
You didn't go to school in the clothes that I had to wear back then
Look at you, fucking faggot, what you looking at, punk?
What, bitch? Give me another shot, hey, what you want?
Make it a double, fuck it, a triple, fuck it, give me the bottle
And then it's bottoms-up, what a positive role model

[Interlude: Shawty Fatt]
Hey wolf, wolf!
Come on man, time to go

[Bridge]
Wake up in the morning feeling like I'm not awake at all, take a Tylenol, shake it off
Wanna take another shot of Jack but Jack D shot me with a sawed-off
Wake up in the morning feeling like I'm not awake at all, take a Tylenol, shake it off
Wanna take another shot of Jack but Jack D shot me with a sawed-off

[Hook]
Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger, can I call you a friend?
My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger, can I call you a friend?
My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground34Embed

Heartbreak Lyrics[Verse 1]
You used to be so cool, what the fuck happened to you?
Look at what all this rapping and money-stacking will do
I could've been stuck out in 'Bama, had I not flew the coop
And my babies would suffer Christmas cause Santa ain't got no loot
Uh, 'money ain't the issue' you said, that's funny now
Cause money's all I could give you to shut your motherfucking mouth
Here, take 20 grand and buy yourself a lawyer
Shit, here's a whip so my kids ain't gotta walk to the store for ya, fuck
Momma told me I should keep it real
My record ain't selling, momma, I'm trying hard enough to keep a deal
Meanwhile I'm throwing paper down into an empty pit
I got a business I'm trying to run, man, fuck this bitch
I should've seen it coming, she never pulled her weight
I'm carrying her like an elephant on a dinner plate
You gassed em, Yelawolf, you better pump your fucking brakes, asshole
You got the nerve to
[Hook 1]
Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down

[Verse 2]
You got some nerve to be mad at me for, fuck, anything
What have I done besides give you what I could not afford?
The kids are happy cause they really don't know anything
If they only knew what toys that their momma could afford
The vacation they could be taking when daddy's on tour
Wait, you are on vacation, that's what this shit is for
I get it, I'm like the fountain of youth
You're in the bed with your boo and you two are sipping courvoisier, true?
This song ain't no diss, it's a living proof
Skit of skin and tooth, the witch in you bit, left me with cracked roofs
I ain't done, bitch, put this shit in loop
Here's a melody so it sticks in your head like your tracks do, ooh

[Post-Verse]
You wanna walk around like it's all good
Cause I'm the golden ticket to get out of the hood
You better hope somebody cares more than I do
Cause my will don't include you
[Hook 1]
Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down

[Hook 2]
There ain't no fucking way I'mma let you take this hard-earned money, bitch
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down

Hold up, wait a minute, let me drop this shit up in it

[Bridge]
There'll always be a special place
For you in my bank account
You fucking bitch

[Hook 1]
Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down
[Hook 2]
There ain't no fucking way I'mma let you take this hard-earned money, bitch
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down39Embed

Daddy’s Lambo LyricsYeller
Hillbilly in Beverly Hills
And so Drama beats

[Verse 1]
Hold up, damn rich, peanut butter guts in the Lamborghini, woah
You must have white bread, lets make a sandwich
No I ain't never seen money like you got
Nobody got that kind of money in the boondocks
So if you take me up and show me the balcony looking over
The Hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop
Popstars like you need a dude like me
To appreciate your wealth
I know you got a elevator in your house
But with me you'll appreciate the steps
Act like you don't wanna see how much of this Jack Daniels you can handle
You wanna drink and get cut like Rambo?
And let me drive your Daddy's Lambo
[Hook]
Take me up to Beverly Hills
To your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with Kim
Entertainment Channels
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?

[Verse 2]
You're young and reckless, nice little diamond necklace
Gotta pint-sized vodka drink and you're pretty in pink
Wanna go get breakfast?
But you ain't never been to Waffle House
Always hanging in Guys and Dolls
If you came to the South, I'd put you in the Chevrolet
And we'd slide to the mall
Yeah I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and a DTA hoody
But I'm walking through the party with Rogue Status looking for Beverly Hill goodies
Yelawolf and I'm an Alabama boy
Got more bounce than a salamander boy
Need a rich girl like I need a headache
But I'll take it if I can drive your Daddy's toy
[Hook]
Take me up to Beverly Hills
To your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with Kim
Entertainment Channels
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?

[Verse 3]
What you got in that tote bag
That one of a kind Prada
That beautiful behind inspires me
Makes one of my rhymes harder
Your daddy made a fine daughter
Make me wanna turn this wine from water
Keep the party going in the 808 blowing cause Drama made a beat that'll climb the chart up
Money, money, money, money, money
Ain't it funny what a honey in a Lamborghini will do
Some will run into a hundred dollar bill
And drill a dick on any Tom and Harry with a 24 inch shoes
But come and explore this dude
Analyze my swing
It's Slick Rick E. Bobby, baby
Gotta let me drive that thing, come on
[Hook]
Take me up to Beverly Hills
To your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with Kim
Entertainment Channels
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh

I see you bitches talking loud but you ain't saying shit
Get the fuck from round here, you don't rep my shit
You ain't from my city, you don't know about this
You don't want that drama, you ain't ready for it, bitch

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I already got, two cars in the yard that don't run
So why would I wanna break shit down for you
Better me confuse with the punchlines and bars that I launch
Here the king of debauchery come, with a cracker dick
To fuck you in that pussy carpet you munch
If I'm not hardly the one
You must be barely the one billionth
Really you kidding, bitch I'm the prodigal son
And I'm stunting like my Daddy
D-dr-d-drinking like my Mama
C-c-country like my uncles
Stuttering like a CD in a donk
BUMP, BUMP, BUMP, BUMP
And I'm in a blue Chevy
Running over motherfuckers in first
I ain't even shift gears yet
I ain't even here yet, I'm outta this Earth
Right, yeah ho
But I just hit the surface
And I'm bout to walk into a bank
With a shank and a black can of paint to check the clerk
Where the keys
Bitch you better check your purse
I gotta brick of herb
And I hit the syrup
And I'm feeling like I might just hit the curb
So get the fuck outta my way buddy
You don't wanna run around the chicken house with a heart of a puppy dog
Yelawolf and Eminem shit
Sufferin' succotash, yeah suck a dick bitch
[Hook: Gangsta Boo]
I see you bitches talking loud but you ain't saying shit
Get the fuck from round here, you don't rep my shit
You ain't from my city, you don't know about this
You don't want that drama, you ain't ready for it, bitch
Now throw it up, yeah, ho, throw it up
Throw it up, yeah, ho, you ain't ready for it, bitch
Throw it up, yeah, ho, throw it up, throw it up
You ain't ready for it, bitch

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Bitch please you don't wanna step up to this Misses

I'm up in the building, preachin' to my children

You'll make me hurt one of your feelings
Ha ha ha ha
Nah nah ni nah nah
Pick your face up off the floor
I got you feeling sad now
You be on that Hokiewag, Hokiewag is bullshit
Run into this Gangsta, have your preacher at the pulpit bitch
I was born on the Mississippi River
Take no shit from a bitch or a nigga
So, so crazy gotta fucked up temper
Bi-pola', not Nicki I'm worser, I'll hurt ya

Ma nigga, I'm a lion, untamed
Hunt ya ass down in my jungle, I do this

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Me and Yelawolf
Tear the roof off this motherfucker
You ain't got the umph
You're a hoof to the foot of an elephant
Hello toots, you look so eloquent
That's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kicking my seat
And I'm trying to tell the cashier what I want
They say I act like an asshole
When I pull up at the White Castle
And I ask for an appli-cation
Throw it back in her face and
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her
In the head with a Whopper
That I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately slut, ho
Skidda dee da da
Prada, not a chance
I was thinking about buying you some clothes
But Target's closed
So I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart but the doors
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought
Great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what'dya know
They didn't carry a size eight in hoes
Oh, this is ugly boy swag
Putting toe tags on you motherfucking ho bags
What a Trailer Trash pioneer
I am yeah, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two
Bout sign language, middle fingers aimed at you
So we don't gotta scream at you
Ow, I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident
I went to go tell em all to go get fucked
But I'm never gonna bite my tongue
Little bitch, throw it up
[Outro: Yelawolf + Eminem]

What the fuck is this, White dog
Yo
Yo, what' up?

Devil in My Veins Lyrics[Intro]

Michael Wayne
I love you my darling
My angel since birth
Mercy stay beside you

[Yelawolf]
Alright, I love you

[Mother]
I love you too. Bye

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been afraid of myself
The closer that I get to rain
The more I feel at home, the further I'm away
And all that I feel is pain

Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
Crimson tears falling
And my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins
[Verse 2]
The morning’s a cross I bear when I wake
Am I asleep? Have I broken my faith?
Down on my knees, can you hear me when I pray?
Or am I a little too late to...

[Hook]
Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
Cause these crimson tears falling
And my shirt is blood-stained
Cause the devil's forever in my veins
Cause the devil's forever in my veins

Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
These crimson tears falling
And my shirt is blood-stained

Box Chevy V Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm out the gate like a race horse, made in the A of course
That's A for Alabama, I'll be damned if I say Georgia
Tennessee in this bitch, I got some Hennessy that's paid for
Give me the big bottle, fuck it, if I break it, I'll pay for it
My ladies laying in the Chevrolet and I say "Lord
Thank you for giving me this baby girl on a suede horse"
Yeah, this ain't no gay Ford
I'm pushing bowties till I die and I'm gonna ride 'til my legs sore
Vogues I got a set "4", plus a Beretta sitting in the floor
Better protect yours

[Hook]
In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet
Got that Glock laid in my lap
In case you want to play
In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet
Let's go get you all cleaned up
And ride around all day
[Verse 2]
(Still) hitting them corners on the low pro's, girl
(Still) I'm an American Rock N Roll grand baby
Five generations of taking pictures with Grand-Am
The Chevrolet Slim Shady, there's no way you can save me
Bass boat flakes, you never seen such
Roll down  my window like "Who I am doesn't mean much"
Burning tread off a thousand-dollar tires with a clean touch
Six hundred horses running behind the mean clutch
Bitch, I'm

[Hook]
In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet
Got that Glock laid in my lap
In case you want to play
In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet
Let's go get you all cleaned up
And ride around all day

[Verse 3]
Yea, windows washed, looking like a glass house
Glaze on the dash, leather is smelling like Ralph Lauren
Feels like I'm watching television on a couch snorin'
I must be dreaming leaning back inside this chariot
Hitch on the back of this truck, my Harley I carry it
A chalice in wonderland, fill up my cup with
Jack D and take my fucking keys so that I don't, wreck it
Let me come sit on the passenger side and check it
How does it feel from over here? Oh, bless it
This is for all the Chevy's that are collected
Big trucks, low riders, whatever the best is
To you man I just want to give you a message
Uh', I used to sit on sidewalks like everyday
Watching punks and chumps in donks get hella paid
But I just focused on my vision and never quit n'
Now man I'm sittin' in my vision with a reason to celebrate
I'm

In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet

Animal Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah i’d like to sing you a little ditty
[Chorus: Fefe Dobson]
They should’ve never, ever let you out
Cold animal with a mouth from the South
What you gonna say, what you gonna do
As you know they comin', comin' after you
Watch out for the D-Boys
Watch out for the boys in blue
You better keep it movin', big boy
You know they’re takin' shots at you
Cos you’re an animal, oh

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Here we go, Alabama's own buddy, Promenade
And I’m in the zone now, everybody
Bringin' em home baby, to the stage
Slick Rick E. Bobby in a Nascar
Runnin' over motherfuckers like I’m in a bar
Sentimental motherfuckers in a cookie jar
Be the late night snack I’m Santa Claus
Down in Panama beach, drunk in my underalls
Playin' underwear volleyball with your broad
I ain't bothered by your triple D's, not at all
Let me hold em up for ya baby while you walk
Wanna get the party bumpin' let me do my thing
Get the marijuana plant need watering
Throw it in a bong let it start bubbling
Know what I mean, Butter bean, Badda Badda Bing
Trashy white, pass the mic, yeah I’m doin' em dirty
Fists start pumpin' when I’m in the lights, like I’m rappin' in Jersey
Never get elegant
In elementary, never learned to write in cursive
Raised by the country B-Boys, I’m elegantly perfect
Rack it in, pack em in, to the back again, wrap it up
Rap it in, sicker than a pack of ten mini-thins
You’ll get when I win but I won’t lose
In fact I’m gonna win, win again with another hand
Here’s another hand, here’s another hand
Dealer, can I get another hand
Here's a hand, king king king king king
Bitch, Ghet-O-Vision in the Dirty South
And you know we're gettin' clean, rich yeah!
[Chorus: Fefe Dobson]
They should’ve never, ever let you out
Cold animal with a mouth from the South
What you gonna say, what you gonna do
As you know they comin', comin' after you
Watch out for the D-Boys
Watch out for the boys in blue
You better keep it movin', big boy
You know they’re takin' shots at you
Cos you’re an animal, oh

[Verse 2]
Candy-coated whip, runnin' over candy coated rappers (Vroom!)
Panties on her drip, do a back flip for me baby be an acrobatic actor (Action!)
Do a cart wheel on a bar
Will you do a cart wheel while I chill on a bar stool
Will I throw a dart at a wet seal
Well if I see a whale I’m a throw a fuckin' harpoon
Go Looney Toons, and lose your fruit of the looms
To prove you’re in the room, you’re shroomin' to the moon
But in the mornin' you’re wakin' up like a broom
Swept off your feet cause Yelawolf ain't a groom
I ain’t poppin' the cherry, I’m poppin' berry
Moonshine, hop in the bedroom let's move
If you wanna compare me, compare me
To a legend don’t compare me to a young fool
Go get a gun, go get a gun, I'll get a Cinnabun, now sit upon your fuckin' roof
I live it son, I get it done, fuck anyone
Yeah fuck anyone who ain't fuckin' with the crew
Yeah throw another bucket in the pool, dry it out now everybody skate
Cause I’m a lord, I'mma doggytown, (WOLF!) A.L.A.B.A.M.A, my state
My state of my mind 1985 wide body, lookin' for the little small town keg party
Wanna get drunk, wanna fall up in a hottie, get shitty like a porta-potty
So, jump on the paddy wagon like a Pakistani
Packin' a Mac 11, with a pack of maniacs, 11:30
Back at it again, I'm ready for the battle, when and where muthafucka?
They let another cracker in, yeah!
[Chorus: Fefe Dobson]
They should’ve never, ever let you out
Cold animal with a mouth from the South
What you gonna say, what you gonna do
As you know they comin', comin' after you
Watch out for the D-Boys
Watch out for the boys in blue
You better keep it movin', big boy
You know they’re takin' shots at you
Cos you’re an animal, oh18Embed

Love Story Lyrics[Pre-Hook]
When this well runs dry
I guess you'll find another well
When I say goodbye
There'll be another breeze to sail
When my boat goes down
I guess you'll learn how to swim
If I don't come home
Just know you've been a good friend

[Hook]
Don't forget me
I love you so
Don't forget me
I've never let you go
Don't forget me
Love is the story I wrote
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
[Verse]
If God is my angel, the fucking devil's the pistol
Better put your face behind safety glass when I load up this missile
Whistling past this infinite path, I limp when I track
My footprints like a giant, look at this mountain
Bounce on my boots and then climb it
Mount up my troops and defiantly
Go against what they trying, teach 'em to shoot what I'm rhyming
Be living proof of my word, meaning I'm Bible designing
Jesus I'm rival, decapitating put the bait on my line and
Throw the hook to the open water
Fish till I catch that motherfucker
Looking for Megalodon, Goliath, Leviathan, I have been dying to find him and tie him to my boat and chop him up and dine with him on a plate with a steak and a coke
Rely on patience and hope, speak to a nation at shows
Reach through these speakers and grab you, turn the bass up and then choke
And I earned my place on this road, ain't nobody moving me, no way
No, how, OK, go, pow
When I was born they said exorcise and the hospital set on fire
The preacher got goosebumps when he saw me and said "Messiah"
Yea from the heavens, I have arose from the ashes of hell
Brought here to be poor white trash and excelled
Stuck in the woods of 'Bama, wood like math on the shelf
A scientist under development with nines and twelves and threes
And things like pyramids and fuck it you'll see
How I made a pot of gold from a bucket of beans
How I made it back to dry land, stuck in the sea
From crippled ships to triple dipped Z's 71's
Yeah it's already begun and I ain't even had a hit but I'm fuckin' ready for one
I got my weight up like I'm carrying fat people
I planned it, I landed
Touch down, that's eagle
But above all the guts glory it's more than just blood for me
My heart is half open for the ones that never gave a fuck for me
My love story
Oh (Yeah yeah)
Oh...
Oh (Yeah yeah)
[Outro]
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
Yeah uh yeah uh yeah29Embed

Box Chevy 3 Lyrics[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yelawolf and I feel like a king in my box Chevy
Tell them other wack muthafuckas to get they pine box ready
Catfish Billy is deadly, don't get slapped with the medley
Still sippin' on Jack D to my neck and my head start feelin' heavy
Doin' one-twenty five down I-29
Really think I need to start slowin' down
But I can't 'cause I got a pretty little blonde thing
Sittin' to my right that's blowin' me now
Oh yeah, she's headin' me
I think her name might be Becky
I was about to drop her off
But I had to switch lanes to get the brain she begged me
Aww naw, do you come in twos?
Please choose a couple of friends that could hop in and cruise
Now we goin' steady, but I'm not lookin' for longevity
Pipes in the back, the lights of the night reflect sights through the dash, I'm nice to ride pass
[Hook: Yelawolf]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
Tilted off Jim Beam, sittin' low, to the side I lean
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Fuck a limousine, I'd rather ride Caprices
My speakers vibrate the concrete beneath us
Ridin' 85 northbound, shakin' doors down
So I turn the speakers louder, pissin' off polices
Fuck a five-star chick, got a pornstar bitch
Ridin' shotgun with me, gettin' so wet
Now she goin' down on me givin' roadhead
Bustin' on her forehead then I take her back to the homestead
Peace, back in the Caprice took a sack of weed
And crumpled it inside a cognac blunt wrap
Then it's time to jump back on the highway 85
Slumpin' in my seat like I'm hunchback
And my Chevy lookin' so dope
Old school Vogues on it got it floatin' like a rowboat
Gold flakes in the candy paint drippin' on the road
Drivin' slow like a mothafuckin' showboat, ho
Don't act like you don't hear me comin'
I got the Willis Drummond and it's comin' out the clarion
Twelves in the trunk, flatscreen TVs in the headrest with Something About Mary on, carry on
I be turnin' heads every time when you see me in the Chevy
Man, it's evident she car-struck
And I'm far from hard up so quit trippin' like a bitch
And get in the car, slut, girl you know you wanna ride
[Hook: Yelawolf]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
Tilted off Jim Beam, sittin' low, to the side I lean
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy

[Verse 3: Yelawolf] (Only on Trunk Muzik 0-60)
In the background with a six-pack now
And I’m out lookin' for the ladies
Peanut butter seats have seat girl my peanut butter needs jelly
I'll chase you like Chevy if you ain't afraid to get messy
If you know the game then I'll let you call the shots like a referee
Now I’m drinkin' a deuce deuce, swig it slow
Feelin like I’m Deuce Deuce Bigalow
Pick a bitch like I pick a piccolo
Go anywhere you wanna go, pick a road
Interstate 59, 20, 75, 285, 85 southbound
Twins pipes like pow-pow
Hundred spokes on the Vogues like wow, wow, wow
[Hook: Yelawolf]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
Tilted off Jim Beam, sittin' low, to the side I lean
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats

Hard White (Up In The Club) Lyrics[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
You ain't gotta lay down on your back
To know you already fucked up
Letting me in the muthafuckin' game is like
Letting me drunk drive in ya truck
When Yelawolf arrived in this club, already had 5 in my cup
Then I took another hit and I run into a bitch
That's looking lifeless and stuck
Baby, what's wrong with you now?
What, you ain't happy with Red Bottoms?
Mad cause I'm in VIP with a fuckin' Jack bottle?
With Tom, Dick and Harry
I got up in this bitch with a tank top cause I spit so very, darn quick and scary
That's why they're so quick to compare me
But fuck my critics with a spiked dick
When it can fit barely. They probably think I'm a Limp Bizkit
That spits jelly, when I put them in the woods I'm a redneck
I'm a hick? Tell me: go ahead, yeah!
What the fuck does it matter to me?
Cause after me there'll only be wannabes
And mostly ain't never gonnabes
Yeah in this forest I'm a lonely tree
My limbs are covered in tattoos -and my roots they run deep
[Chorus 1]
I'm 2 bottle shawty, 2 bitches waiting
Two 10's: that's a "win-win situation"..
Happy birthday, I'm feelin' brand-new
Drinks on me! For ME: not you

[Chorus 2]
Up in the club, don't give a fuck
Up in the club, don't give a fuck
Up in the club, don't give a fuck
Up in the club, still don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know what to say after that first verse
I mean like damn, I just killed it
What the fuck am I supposed to do with this cow?
I done already milked it
Smoke another cigarette unfiltered
Let go of anything that I’m feelin’
They done broke me down so many times before
That I'm no longer rapping I'm building
With one brick, two brick, three brick, four
Underneath the steps of my single wide door
Raised by them dope boys, so I know how them thangs look
Thanks for the recipe: rest in peace, Wayne Bush
I don't cook my shit, I don't break it down for you muthafuckas
Out there waiting around for some rap savior
You better look up at what it is that you facing now
Cause Jesus drives a Harley, the Devil wears Prada
If God was one of us, he'd probably drink vodka
I still kick it at the party when I get rich
Cause rich or broke, I'm still as dope
The realest ain't as real as this
Dead or alive, I'll put a stamp in this bitch
You'll never seen rock and roll do hip-hop like I did
[Chorus 1]
I'm 2 bottle shawty, 2 bitches waiting
Two 10's: that's a "win-win situation"..
Happy birthday, I'm feelin' brand-new
Drinks on me! For ME: not you

[Chorus 2]
Up in the club, don't give a fuck
Up in the club, don't give a fuck
Up in the club, don't give a fuck
Up in the club, still don't give a fuck

[Outro]
Yeah ya
Y'all know we dont give a fuck!
It’s Gheto-Vision
Yeah!
Shady
Yeah!
Still dont give a fuck
Naaaahhh!… your boy, lil John… we rep the South!
Happy birthday, Alabama
Hey! hey!
Up in the club
Together: dont give a fuck
Aaah…
Up in the club, still dont give a fuck
I ain't in the building, I own the building, Bitch!15Embed
