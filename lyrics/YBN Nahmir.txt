Rubbin off the Paint Lyrics[Intro]
That's what I thought you said
Now let me offer this as a rebuttal
Ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang

[Verse]
They say, "Lil' Nahmir, where you been at?" I'm just passin' a breeze
I been runnin' up a check, that's why these bitches on me
I been coolin', layin' low, but I'm not takin' a seat (Izak made this one)
But just know a nigga back and this time I won't leave
I been runnin', runnin', runnin', gotta check me a bag
I got hunnids on my neck and I got Trues on my ass
Niggas said I'm goin' broke, well, I just take it and laugh
I be speedin' in that foreign with Five-O on my ass
But I'm that nigga, I won't ever change, rubbin' off the paint
Smokin' dank, got a Uzi in my lap, I let it bang
Free Lil Tay, know he keep a 'K, but he not Tay-K
I up the chop and let it blow him, watch this bitch heat his face, I'm that nigga
And all my young niggas pullin' triggers, we gorillas
We let this bitch off until you feel us, for you niggas
That's always on IG with them yiggies, takin' pictures
Is you really gon' use 'em or you just loafin' for them bitches?
You niggas really hoes and you be actin' like these bitches
You niggas say y'all silent, but y'all probably in there snitchin'
Most the niggas that's around me throwin' C's like they Crippin'
But they do it for the twins, free Lil Corey and Lil Christian
But I'm rockin' with my shooters and that's mandatory
One up top like I'm Mozzy, bitch, I keep a .40
You say I'm lackin', nigga, try me, shoot you and your shorty
I'm cookin up in the lab like I'm Rick and Morty
40 poppa, hit a mobsta, turn your brain to pasta
Hit a opp up, dreads swangin' just like I'm a Rasta
Smokin' ganja and I'm zooted, walkin' in my Pradas
Any nigga test my gangsta, nigga, I'ma pop 'em
And we ain't throwin' hands with you fuck niggas
It's one up top up in that chamber, better duck, nigga
Niggas dissin' on Lil Valley, he get slumped, nigga
We shoot his body, then we lay him in that trunk nigga
I'm one-hundo, bitch, that's on my life, I will never fold
A nigga speakin on Lil Quay, well then, that nigga gotta go
I'm really small, but I can fight, but I'ma still up that pole
For you niggas think I'm pussy, you gon' have to show me, ho
Police always at my fuckin' crib, I don't tell 'em shit
I'm really rapping 'bout this fuckin life that I fuckin' live
But I be coolin', tryna focus on them fuckin' dividends
But if it's money near your head, well, I'ma fuckin get it, man

All these tattoos on my fuckin' body, she say I'm a hottie
Why your girlfriend always wanna fuck me, wanna touch my body?
We got all type of fuckin' guns, might even have a Tommy

'Cause no, I can't be lackin' in these streets, I keep a big pole
And I can't have no nigga with me if they gon' snitch on us28Embed

[Verse]
Real thorough nigga, I ain't never switched up (Nigga)
Couple niggas say I changed 'cause the big bucks (Nigga)
I ain't never change, I just see you leachin' on me (Leachin' on me)
Got mad, now my niggas started speakin' on me (They speakin' on me)
Ayy, it's a shame how they changed, nigga (How they changed, nigga)
Rockin' baby, so I'm stayin' in my lane withcha (In my lane withcha)
Niggas turned they back on me but you stayed with me (Stayed with me)
Only rocking with a few like my nigga Glizzy (Glizzy, nigga)
Nigga speaking on my name when I'm not around (Not around, ayy)
When I'm around, they thinkin' 'bout how they gon' knock me down (They knockin' down niggas)
But it's cool, I'm thinkin' 'bout how I'm gon' get dough (Get dough)
By any means and that's if I gotta kick door
You dependin' on me, well you a man too (You niggas broke)
Get off your ass and go and show me what that Glock do
Ayy, man this shit be so crazy (Goin' crazy, nigga)
I ain't even no Blood, but my mind goin' brazy (Not no blood, nigga)
Ayy, damn, this shit fucked up
My own man shot at me and missed, so he lucked up
That shit hurts, cause that nigga was my ten hut (My ten-hut, nigga)
Over a bitch, little nigga why you switched up? (Why you switched up?)
Ayy, it's so crazy how these niggas is
Like I'm 50, I be watchin' out for many men (Many men, ayy)
It's niggas tryna kill me just 'cause they done seen me up (Seen me up)
Hatin' from my own city, keep that shit a buck (Gang)
Say, on my life I'ma try to put this city on (Put it on)
But if I don't put it on, Clink got the throne (He got the throne, nigga)
Niggas snakes in the grass, so my grass cut
And if my time come, bitch, I was really up (Uh, nigga)
End of the day, I just do it for my nigga Valley
Why the fuck they had to put my nigga in that Caddy?
Ayy, broken hearts leave a nigga sad (Nigga sad, ayy)
When you died I wasn't sad, it just made me mad (Hate it, nigga)
Bro, we had so much shit planned out (We had it planned out)
Skippin' states, we was thinkin' 'bout them band routes
Niggas speakin' on yo name, tryna get some fame (Get some fame, nigga)
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas, I got perfect aim
Labels steady hittin' up about some signin' shit (About some signin' shit)
It's YBN, big brother, I ain't signin' shit
You always told me stay up and don't settle for less (Less, nigga)

Ayy

Ooh, B-Bighead on the Beat

[Hook]
They ain't stop making guns when they made yours
All ya niggas do is type on them keyboards
We’ll slide and knock you out with them big toys
All my niggas straight jumping, fucking kill Roy
We ain't really with the talking, we gon let em have it

Make a nigga disappear like it was some magic
They ain't stop making guns when they made yours
All ya niggas do is type on them keyboards
We’ll slide and knock you out with them big toys
All my niggas straight jumping, fucking kill Roy
We ain't really with the talking, we gon let em have it

Talk tough lil bitch, watch ya get the clapping
Make a nigga disappear like it was some magic
[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm never lackin', I keep running your head
That choppa bullet is gonna knock off your leg
You run up on me, then I'm leaving you dead
I leave you dead, if you talk to the feds
Gotta watch yo back, cause these niggas be snakes
The money come, then these niggas turn fake
You play with me, they find you dead in the lake
Not like the wire, find you dead in the grave
I got a TEC-9, it came from Baghdad, so they gonna flag that
Uzi from San Francisco, my homie pass that
This Glock turn you to a zombie, it give you whiplash
Speedin' off in the Hemi, that man, he crash that
I'm tatted up, watch me fuck on your bitch
I could fuck her even if you was rich
But if you rich, then I'm takin' yo shit
Say you the plug, then I takin' yo brick
Say on my life, I ain't running from shit
You think it's static till yo bro meet the clip
Little nigga talking, 30 shots at his lip
We catch him loafing, 30 shots at his whip

[Hook]
They ain't stop making guns when they made yours
All ya niggas do is type on them keyboards
We’ll slide and knock you out with them big toys

Nerd niggas, they gon' hate, I'ma do me
Let a nigga touch me, leave him 6 deep
6 deep in your bitch, watch your bitch splash
Young nigga, flip a block up with no mask (ayy)
Lil Zeke tried to flip, caught a toe tag
Seen the whip, hit the lights then got on that

Up-Top Baby Lyrics[Intro: YBN Nahmir]
We just bounce out with that .44, nigga, ayy

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
On my life, when I up, he gon' freeze up
When it's cold, I'ma stick with that heat tucked
It's YBN, lil' nigga get your team up
Remember all the days I was broke, now my cheese up
Take a-take a L, bounce back on some new shit
Kick a door, bounce out with them blue strips
MAC-10 and it came with a tool kit
Nigga try me, on my life, I'ma use it
I'm a Up-Top Baby, give a fuck about a white scale
And I ain't sugar-coatin' shit, this my lifestyle
Up the chop', let it blow at a big crowd
Now they see me on the news and they like, "wow"
Sike naw, let me chill, I'm a smooth nigga
But I still bounce out with that tool, nigga
You know I keep that rocket in my Trues, nigga
With YG, you be drippin' with them Ru' niggas
Real bad bitch and she suckin' on my dick
And you really think I'm trippin', if you think I eat the clit
Ayy, ayy, lil' nigga I'm the shit
What the fuck I look like tryna eat out a bitch? Ayy
If my brother get to trippin', then I'm trippin' too
If my nigga say he slidin', then I'm slidin' too
Hit a block, double back, we done hit a few
Bullets hot so they can melt 'em like a fuckin' cube
[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Niggas know
If I up it, I'ma let that shit go
Bounce out with poles (bouncin' out, nigga)
If a nigga want smoke, he get smoked
Niggas know
If I up it, I'ma let that shit go (let it go, nigga)
Bounce out with poles (bouncin' out, nigga)
If a nigga want smoke, he get smoked

[Verse 2: YBN Nahmir]
If I ever go broke, I'ma get it out your bitch
If I ever go down, guaranteed that won't stick
Stitched lips, dumb clips, I'll eat a lil' bitch
First off, free Yadda, Kirko Lan in this bitch
Shout out that nigga Mozzy, know I'm fuckin' with the gangland
Shooter gang, bitch, Deuce Jojo let that thing blast
Know that four ton fizzy left a nigga with a red tan
Hollow tips shootin' out the clip like he Plankton
Plankton, Plankton, Plankton
Big choppers, hella clips, knock a bitch down
Glizzy hella geekin' he rock out with them Glocks out
Nigga snitchin', he got popped right when we found out
New Rollie on my wrist, cop a chain in this bitch
Knock a bitch nigga down when I'm dumpin' the clip
Thuggin' hella extra, while a nigga up in that mix
And the turf never lackin', bitch you know I keep a stick
Never duckin' no smoke and I put that on the dead homies
Nigga run up, catch a shot with your main homie
Fruity lil' bitch and that bitch go insane on me
Better duck your taco when we slidin' in that Range, homie
On my life, on my mama I'll bust that
When I get paid I bet I'll cop that Cadillac
You niggas broke and you still shop at rent a sacks
And if I think you feelin' iggy I'ma push you back
[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Niggas know
If I up it, I'ma let that shit go
Bounce out with poles (bouncin' out, nigga)

Gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse]
Please don't make me up the chop and blow a nigga down
Slide down, bet that nigga catch a hundred rounds
You a nerd-ass boy, nigga, look around
I have my young wild nigga put you in the ground
No stocks, big Glocks, tote K clips
When it's foe, we gon' blow, we gon' paint shit
Been knew your background, you's a ho bitch
I'll take that lil' strap, you won't do shit
I'm a eastside nigga, getting to the cash
Pull up on a nigga, leave a nigga laying in that grass
Go to jail but I don't really give a fuck
And if you snitching, have my bitch come and rough you up
Bitch at my pad, but you already know
If she not sucking dick, then that bitch gotta go
No lovey-dovey shit, 'cause I heard you was a ho
I just wanna fuck that bitch, I just used her for the throat
And I'm a up-top baby, I be quick to hit a lick
Bitches on my dick, now they wanna take a pic
Opps know my name 'cause I've been with that shits
So don't try to test me 'cause you can still meet the clip, bitch
I'm a Alabama nigga fucking with the Bay
Shout out my nigga Peezy, he be catchin' plays
And I'ma always be me, I won't ever change
Open fire on a nigga, make him feel that blaze
In the crest with lil' Deez, chillin', smokin' loud
Good trips to Oakland, come back with a pound
Get caught with big poles, we won't make a sound
We shoot to kill niggas, then swing back around
Drunk of Henny, so now I'm feeling like the shit
You won't catch me in the whip unless a .30 in that bitch
Let a ho suck the player, have 'em sit up in the den
Hit licks with no mask, it's just my blower in yo' crib
Mix the dope with my rich bro, finish out the pot
Way before I started rappin', I was known on the block
Big MACs and ARs, but I was mobbing with a Glock
Told gang "just hold on 'cause we gon' make it to the top"
Dog, how these niggas talkin', got 'em sounding like my kids
You know how I'm coming over dead presidents
Shot somes niggas, beat a case, we had to calm down again
All these niggas hate, I'm kinda feeling like they fans
Bitch, you know I'm the one that make it hot quick
Lately I been on my trap shit
Slow down with all of that rappin'
But still, you can catch me in traffic
Twelve come, I know where to stash it
Know I'm still ridin' with a ratchet
In the Bentley, know they praying that I crash it
Niggas fake, broke, ain't never copped shitEmbed

Man Down Lyrics[Intro]
Everything foreign, nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I hear is gunshots (Bang, bang)
Up and down my block (Yeah, ow!)
It don't never stop (Ow!)
Either you in or out
I see the paramedics, news cameras, police choppers
Man down, but they don't know who shot 'em
It's lookin' like The Walking Dead, zombies
Everyday a nigga D.I.E
If anybody scared, fuck from 'round me
If you ain't with the bid'ness, get the fuck from 'round me

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
Slide down on my niggas on tip (Raah!)
30 shots they gon' go through your whip (Hits)
I'm the man, smokin' nigga like a zip
Then turn around and I fuck on his bitch (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
I gotta keep movin', keep one in the Ruger (Ayy)
Bullets hot, they gon' hit your medulla (Yeah)
I'm chasin' the sack, gotta get to the safe
By any means, gotta get that moolah (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
It's gun shots erywhere so, boy, you better hide (You finna hide)
If Breezy say it's fuck you, so you know I'm finna slide (Watch me slide)
Watch me do that walk up, you seen that pole, now he surprised
Hollow tips gon' hit 'em then I'm hoppin' in that ride (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
Say the people took my brother, so I'm screamin', "Fuck the feds" (Boom)
I rather keep that blower 'fore my mama see me dead
If a nigga run up on me, I'ma fill him up with lead (Raah!)
.223's hit his body, pop a nigga like some mints
If I ever hit a lick then you know I'm breakin' bread (I'm breakin' bread)
Niggas snitchin' to the cops, they be talkin' to the feds
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I hear is gunshots (Bang, bang)
Up and down my block (Yeah, ow!)
It don't never stop (Ow!)
Either you in or out
I see the paramedics, news cameras, police choppers
Man down, but they don't know who shot 'em
It's lookin' like The Walking Dead, zombies (Bang, bang)
Everyday a nigga D.I.E (Woo)
If anybody scared, fuck from 'round me (Bang, bang)
If you ain't with the bid'ness, get the fuck from 'round me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You better find that exit (Exit)
Stop that flexin' (Stop)
Before I send you to the Reverend
All my niggas reckless, you get the message
None of y'all ain't gon' shoot (Pow)
Niggas lame, tryna complain
Bitches still snitchin' if you tell the truth (oh woah-oh-oh)
You ain't 'bout shit, now leave (Shit, now leave)
And now I got a dick on me (Dirty clip)
I made this bitch feel my piece (Yeah, yeah)
And she ain't never felt one of these
Yeah, tell her bend over
Then I shot man down, it's over
Then a man hit Coke just like soda
Man tellin' lie, lemme kill all the rumors
Mash up the pussy, gah run, run to her
Whine up for me, you gotta come sooner (Ow!)
Nigga headless, knock out the tumor
Give 'em good dick now all I hear is...
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I hear is gunshots (Bang, bang)
Up and down my block (Yeah, ow!)
It don't never stop (Ow!)
Either you in or out
I see the paramedics, news cameras, police choppers
Man down, but they don't know who shot 'em
It's lookin' like The Walking Dead, zombies (Bang, bang)
Everyday a nigga D.I.E (Woo)
If anybody scared, fuck from 'round me (Bang, bang)
If you ain't with the bid'ness, get the fuck from 'round me3Embed
