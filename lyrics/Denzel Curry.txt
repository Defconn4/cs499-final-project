ULTIMATE Lyrics[Intro: Ronny J]
Ronny J, listen up

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (God damn)

[Verse 1]
Great, eliminate like ElimiDate (Ooh)
Hey, young boy had to penetrate (Ooh)
Face, young boy done caught a case (Ooh)
Bang, now his mama livin' with the pain (Uh)
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay (Huh?)
Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate (Oh)
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state (damn)
Denzel Curry is the new candidate (Damn)
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus (Esophagus)
Bitches be boppin' it, bow down and pop it in
Droppin' it in her esophagus (Esophagus)
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it (Uh)
Girl, I can make you a star (Star, ooh)
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch (Damn)
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist (Flame)
Rippin' through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus (Damn)
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm livin' so harmonious (Harmonious)
Feelin' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics
[Bridge]
Bitch, I'm ultimate
Ultimate
Bitch, I'm

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (Damn)
[Verse 2]
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put in parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, "Is he fake? Is he real?"
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous, so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches lookin' thirsty
Ridin' through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story
[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates345Embed

You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

I don't even know what to feel, they don't even know what's real
Dry tears with a dollar bill, I'm out tryna make a mill', oh
Why you wanna take my soul? I'm yelling out, "Hell no!"
I can't even trust my friends, most of them might be foes
Watch these hoes when they say they want a lot of me
I don't know who's the one that wanna plot on me
I stay low so my demons don't acknowledge me
When I go, I know death don't do apologies

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help

I need hella bass, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

Know when it rains, it pours, they wanna go to war
For things that they can't afford, I gotta grab the sword, preach
I gotta thank the Lord, I gotta go record (Heat)
I wanna be fly to soar 'cause niggas be trying to floor me
People be thinkin' that I won the lottery
So paranoid, I don't know who be plotting on me
Out of nowhere try to fight you
I'm feeling like Raichu 'cause everything shocking to me
Gotta beware of the wicked, the time will be ticking
Them niggas still clocking on me
Lord is my witness, I handle my business
You niggas ain't never ball blocking on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help

(Ronny J, listen up)

[Verse 1: Lofty305]
This that Zu shit, suwoo maroon shit
Niggas talkin' all that shit but they ain't really doin' it
Niggas say that he a goon, he ain't tryna prove it
CSPG be the movement, free Ruben

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
This that motherfuckin' Zu shit but this that new shit
I never gave a fuck like I'm a prude, bitch, just know I do's this
Your stuff drier than a prune, bitch, hit up with the pool stick
My bullets, they aren't acoustic, free Nell and free Slikk

[Verse 3: Lofty305]
And that purp' gettin' smoked, put that on my broomstick
Cultivatin' all the racks off these fuckin' 'shrooms, bitch
Metro Zu, we go to ATL you, know we boomin'
Put yo bitch right on a track, Ronny J produced it
[Verse 4: Denzel Curry & XXXTENTACION]
'Cause, bitch, I'm a Raider Klan killer, ULT nigga (Yeah)
Smoke all the purp', extort the dealer

[Verse 5: XXXTENTACION]
You a fuck nigga, I can't fuck with ya
Wig split, peel 'em, pussy nigga killa
Face, I'ma stomp, body dumped in my trunk, bitch
Glock by my dick, if you tweak, I'ma stick, ayy
Fuck do you mean? Aim that beam at your spleen
If you Purrp, I'll put your face in the dirt
Like pussy, you get creamed
Ayy!

[Verse 6: Ski Mask The Slump God]
(Wet, wet, wet)
Princess Peach jewelry my bitch
Red, white, black Pok√©ball might beep
Beep-boop-beep, Go gadget my wrist
Bling-bling-blaow, Johnny Dang my fist
Wear that pussy out just like a drop and then I dip
I done beat that pussy 'til it's blue, she not a Crip
Diamonds on me red and they white, no zit
Master Roshi wit' it, I done pulled up with a stick, woo
Chopper put holes in 'em, cheesin', mm
Leave blood on the leaves like I'm Yeezus, mm
I eat your soul for no reason, mm
The way that she suck me is treason
Cook, cook, cook, mm
Your grandma wan' poke me on Facebook
I want that booty, no Captain Hook

ULT Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is the wrath of Aquarius
I am the black metal terrorist, ain't no comparison
Humanitarian, bitch, I'm a veteran
Better than anyone comprehend
Snake in the grass, cut the copperhead
Hollow tips point at a copper head
Drop a head, poppin' the Glock 'til the copper dead
But Bishop killed Radames
That is the biggest hypocrisy
I don't see nobody stopping me
Bro, your whole life is a mockery
A militant, mind on a million
Civilian, I am the realest, bitch
No Gilligan, put me on an island
Smoking on an island 'til a nigga look Thailand
Spread through your crew like a motherfucking virus
Cloud 9 confederate, breaking up barriers
Federation in your area
If I'm a bitch, then I guess you a pussy, and pussies are scared of a terrier, woof
Run all your paper, killer Curry keep on catching the caper
Dominating, common denominator
Aftermath, you can just do the math later, as a teenager
I was an underdog under the Raiders, valuable player
Young Bo Jackson slammin' packs with a passion
Satisfaction with the lack of compassion
It's a maverick hella gaspin', but actually
I am that nigga entirely
The same ones that inspire me be the same ones that wanna retire me, nigga
[Chorus]
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)

[Verse 2]
Mystical miracle, I build imperial
I'm analytical, why Lotto had to be off to the clinical
Now we're identical, black individual, no biochemical, serve
Fuck the cops, they the opposition
And these halfway niggas and these halfway hoes
Wanna be buddy-buddy, they see you at a show
But be the main ones that be hating on the low
Wait, that's just irrelevant
They got the fact when you look at my melanin, woah
Cops killin' niggas, niggas killin' brothas, niggas hate each other, don't know
Where the fuck they came from, we the ones that paid dues
I don't watch Fox News, don't mean that all my foxes sly
Find a little white girl, but let you die
Gun like a veteran, breakin' off barriers, they just might call me a terrorist
Rather get caught with it than without it, if I keep it concealed when I carry it, I
Put them on paper
Send them to prison and give them free labor
Separate everyone, make sure they neighbors
Aftermath, after that, we can laugh later
Fuck all my haters
I raise a Black fist as black as the Raiders
Home of the Gators
Federation is my organization
All relation, no religion, no races
Black to Asian, we the nation of U.L.T.
True to you, so keep it true to me
Haters cannot put an end to me because I truly know who is my enemy, nigga
[Chorus]
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)

BLACK BALLOONS | 13LACK 13ALLOONZ Lyrics[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Twelve'len]
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Inside this paper plane
Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote
Taboo and I are in the same boat
What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float
Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute
Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not a mission
See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad
Translated my thoughts and feelings, I pivot into the pad
Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes
Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold
Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated
Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated
Two thousand feet, a thousand steps
I let it all sink to one thousand depths
Soon black balloons pop
Let it be the day the pain stop
[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Twelve'len]
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Heaven or Hell, huh, which one prevails, huh?
We gotta go and figure it out
I tried to tell you that this life isn't it
And I just wanna be the rightest I can be
Show my son to think so he can fly as high can be
Always show examples how they kill niggas like me
Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy
Sun is my attitude, so I'm cool like JAY-Z
√Åndale, √°ndale, my intelligence for threes
Cancel me like I ain't the King of D.C
Cancel me like I ain't the number one G
Cancel me like you don't like "Dance On Me"
Quickly they forget how you change on all these lies
You flashing all these lights, and you savin' these kids lives
And they hate you 'cause you're right, give me hell then, shit
Take your turn to fire and to pitchfork, bitch
[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Twelve'len]
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
[Outro]
Tonight on 102.1, it's Denny Cascade and the gang in town
Denzel, are you really making an album?
I'm telling you, eventually, they're gonna catch up to your game, you're running out of time!
Someone is really trying to hurt me!
It's not enough is it? It's not enough you had us come out here
In the middle of the night
What exactly are you trying to hide, Mr. Curry?55Embed

Oh, damn

First they mockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave, 'cause they see me poppin'
Big-big-big large pockets, they start flockin'
Here's what I say when they ass keep knockin'

[Chorus]
My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers
And never leave your day ones in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My mama said, "Trust no ho, use a rubber"
[Verse 1]
I'ma act, one, two, stop the track
Bring it back, what it do?
See, Ricky said, "Never let nobody get the one up on you
If they run up on you, hit 'em with a one, two or a bitch slap
Leave the cul-de-sac, your brothers gon' have your back regardless
And stick with your day one homies that was here before you started
And fear no man but the man above your head"
"Pray before you go to bed," every day my mama said

[Pre-Chorus]
First they mockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave, 'cause they see me poppin'
Big-big-big large pockets, they start flockin'

My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My mama said, "Trust no ho, use a rubber"

And your mama ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit
And I been makin' waves way before Nostalgic
That was back in Carol City, yeah, when I was just a jit
With the all-black faded Dickie with the Raider fit
That was it, we was lit, y'all wasn't even shit yet (Yeah, ho)
We was Three 6, Wu-Tang mixed with Dipset
Ricky used to take me to my first shows ever
Would only drop jewels way before they dropped cheddar

[Pre-Chorus]
First they mockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave, 'cause they see me poppin'
Big-big-big large pockets, they start flockin'
Here's what I say when they ass keep knockin'

And never leave your day ones in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My mama said, "Trust no ho, use a rubber"

Gook Lyrics[Intro]
Ronny J, listen up

[Verse 1]
I'm a gook!
If I told you that I wasn't then
A nigga wouldn't be telling you the truth
Back in high school, I admit I was a gook
But the way I rap had niggas fooled
Yeah, I'm a gook, niggas started skipping school, me and Monty and Raul
Hopping the fence by Carol City park
Fuck the next class bitch I'm already smart
Yet I'm a gook, see me growing out my hair cause I look like the nigga from Roots
Yeah I'm a gook, Denzel Curry been a gook
Nigga that ain't nothing new
Yeah I'm a gook, probably thinking that I'm fool if I told you that I'm rapping too
Yeah I'm a gook, looking like that nigga Buu
Cut me off, I'm at the booth
Bitch, uh!
[Chorus]
Jabbie told me we gon blow like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like a land mine
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!

[Verse 2]
Loose, with a screw, loose from the Tre Deuce, smoking boof
Bitch, I always knew, that I was a gook
But how this gook, ended up surpassing you?
Why you looking confused?
Made a hard album so what can you do?
I'm the Gook Runner, the Imperial
Shout out to Mook, that be my flesh
Niggas can't fathom that I am the best
I gave you threatz, ultimate next
Shoutout the Klan because that‚Äôs on the set
Fucking with me I will put you to rest
Lie and you‚Äôll remember to speak with your chest
Gooking forever I'm still at your neck
Bitch I'm gooking forever so give me respect, bitch!
[Chorus]
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like a land mine
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!

[Outro]
From the days, I've seen thus far
People tell me that I gook on the daily
One day, I'm gon' be a star
I don't give a fuck if you're gonna hate me
New chains and brand new cars
People tell me that it's all gonna change me
But for now, my mind's on Mars
'Cause you know a nigga gook on the daily51Embed

SIRENS | Z1RENZ Lyrics[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Denzel Curry]
Babe, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back 'round, don‚Äôt let me down
Babe, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Eyesight is a gateway
To a new day and the same hate
With a new height and the same feet
On a airplane yelling, ‚ÄúMayday‚Äù
With a good girl gone bad girl
Who went gay ‚Äôcause of date rape
That's a metaphor for the US
'Cause they got us all in the same state
State of mind, brain is minimized
Put me on the news, only criticize
Revolution will never be televised
For the enemy, they never empathize
And I never voted, never sugar coat it
With my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
When the fire open, let it be your moment
When I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang! (Bang, bang, bang)
This for Trayvon and Tree
Burn the bush and chronic, speakin' honestly
We livin' in colonies, CNN sit-comedies
Monstrosity run rampant all throughout United States
Talkin' about ‚Äúlet's make a fort‚Äù
Talkin‚Äô about ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make it great‚Äù
If the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot
Time to run with lions on the road to Zion
In this age of violence, time to grab the iron
When I pop the silencer, it's nothing but silence when‚Äì
[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Denzel Curry]
Babe, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back ‚Äôround, don't let me down
Babe, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down
[Verse 2: J.I.D]
Uh, look, okay
Ba-aby, I‚Äôm a fool because I thought you would stay
Whether I win or I lose, they already think we dead
But they continue to shoot, I'm just gon' cover my head
I need to duck and not move (Yeah) I bust a move when I (Uh)
Find a way to get on and get up and get out the crib
I was just looking into the mirror
Tryna dislocate my fear 'cause you broke my heart
Let me dry my tears
So serious, I'm so neglected
In the wrong direction with a long erection
Got no protection but it's fuck the world
When she bend it over, being over-sensitive
But did I mention that my real intentions
Are on me really dealin' with the consequences
And I see your tone is very condescending
When I talk to you, but no you won't admit it
And I pity the fool
Been tryna vent, but you ain't tryna hear it
Like I'm not in here, but you gotta hear it
Just stop brushing me off to the side (Oh, shit)
Oh say, can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street
By the dawn's early light, double Sprite and a R.I.P. tee
So proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blaow in the night time
Of the slum house, little drum bump with the one thousand
Come-come, here they come
[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Denzel Curry]
Babe, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
Babe, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down
[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Birds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons
Soul dark as black markets, war is startin', more spartans
Lord, prophet, praise Muhammad, Different Strokes, Philip Drummond
Gave me crack, like I'm plumbin', Jesus Christ, second comin'
Cut myself, now I'm numbin', never scared, never runnin'
Chosen one, I'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for London
Guilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin'
Precedent in abundance, President is a puppet
Gotta hate it, gotta love it, pass a class, I rise above it
Wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù
Donald Trump, Donald Duck, what the fuck is the difference?
Now we stuck in a rut, this ain't what I envisioned
What is what? What is guts when you don't have intuition?
Not a saint, not a sin, tell me, what's my real religion?
Genocide, Genesis, they say it's a new beginnin'
I'm a sinner, you a sinner, I can see the devil grinnin', damn91Embed

Slide for the free, kill for the fee
Pull out the stick then I pull out the ski
Put a motherfucker face on a white tee
That's what a nigga get being P.I.E
Sweet, nigga you D.I.E
Sleep, motherfucker that's six feet
Deep, no tender, no love, no care
But a nigga here still gon' creep
T.L.C. put it to ya Lisa Lo' that's a nigga left
Eye, kill a nigga, get ghost, that
Patrick Swayze, come equipped with a vest
I'mma point that shit to your motherfucking neck
K's all in my trunk, so you best to get a chopper
It's nothing but goon action, I ain't talking Waka Flocka
That 2.7.5. goons bout' to do a fucking gank
Bumping Waka Flocka Flame in a underwater tank
Cause nigga die right now, bullet or a fucking shank
Niggas always tryna' be the hardest in the fucking paint
[Verse 2: Yung Simmie]
Never take kind to the threats
I be off for your neck 'for you reach for the TEC, Simmie
Niggas gon' hear me then fear me, feel me?
Whole bunch of green in my Philly, turn up
Whole bunch of niggas if you run up
Tryna' act hard with your gun up, I shoot your son up
Grinding till the sun up, middle finger flashed
That's a one up, I'm a young gutta
Dog I mutter, Curry said cut ‚Äòem with his brudda
Leave them boys wet like water
Off with his neck, posted with the set
I don't take kindly to threats, take kindly to threats
Ratchet for life, I'm hood, tryna' smoke bad but I‚Äôm good
Bust a nigga head for the cake
Jumping over gates can't wait
Nine to the face, fuck nigga you ain't safe

Savage life, nigga, you don't wanna see me live
Pop more than a quarter, so tell that dime piece
"Bitch, don't kill my vibe", man
I know your bitch love me, I know your bitch want me
She let me pillow pet that kitty when she climb under this Snuggie
Bitch, South Florida, I only smoke mid in Broward
But end the flame of that Magic Dragon and kill that Charmander, bitch
Gone on you niggas, two phones on you niggas
Think I made it? You don't wanna see me ball on you niggas, bitch

This Life Lyrics[Chorus]
Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 9 to 5
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie?
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die?
Are you down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

[Verse 1]
Like, she assigned to me, but you are designed for me
And if I say I got your back then hold my spine for me
And if I couldn't shed a tear, girl, would you cry for me?
And if we was a couple doves, girl would you fly with me?
I'm overseas, what I oversee, ocean sea, see reflections of the way we supposed to be
Unluckily, we not at peace
That's the end of my clover leaf
Wouldn't care if you know it's me
Keep away until you notice me
[Chorus]
Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 9 to 5
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie?
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die?
Are you down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

[Verse 2]
She told me that I wasn't losing her, that she losing me
L-O-V, -E, we outta gas, I'll see you in a week
Thinking that, you won't fornicate with niggas that you meet
But silly me, now we are the same, Cupid admit defeat
Girl, are you out of your mind? I would think you were mine
You were a part of me, pardon me, parts of me died
Idolized you when I didn‚Äôt unite
You won't tell for the moment, but time will tell, but as of now

[Chorus]
You didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 9 to 5
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die
You down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me
[Outro]
Me-e-ayee
She is a side to me
She is a side to me
But you are designed for me-
You're designed for me
But you are designed for me-
You're designed for me56Embed

SPEEDBOAT Lyrics[Intro: J NICS]
I went from stickin' pennies in the jar to offshore bank accounts
See me and my conglomerates is lucrative
I'm talkin' big money, big chains, big guns, nigga
More power

[Chorus]
Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)
Pray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)
Didn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)
People gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)
Have your money up before you go to war (Hmm)
Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24
Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)
Pray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)
Didn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)
People gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)
Have your money up before you go to war (Hmm)
Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24
[Verse 1]
Put a red beam to your head like Arby's
Either go to school, go to jail or the army
Keep a close eye on the things tryna harm me
Warn me if anybody try to swarm me, uh
Invest in the rock and a Rottweiler
Pile up hella stacks when the bills pile up
Dollar is the only way to get the style up
Riled up, catchin' motherfuckers usin' dial-up
My dawg is gone and the result is to have my teflon
Christian Dior and the fashion beyond
Talkin' Polo, call me Polow da Don
Throw some D's on the donk
I got hella keys and the funk
I put hella Gs in the vault
It took only three to assault, damn

[Pre-Chorus]
Jesus, please deliver us from evil
Please pray over all my people
What you see in life's illegal
I don't wanna use my Desert Eagle

Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)

Have your money up before you go to war (Hmm)
Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24
[Verse 2]
Pourin' out scotch
Gas, all in my brain, it fumigated my thoughts
Thinking 'bout intricate plots
To get out the hood, that's when I started to jot
Not givin' the opportunity to let the devil ruin me, no
Even though the jewelry froze, ice cubes get Deeboed
Word on the street, everything heat
Everything hot boy, Texas Pete
Pulled up in a Lexus and a Jeep
All black, no tag, time for the sweep
Too many guns, too many sons
Lost in the river of blood in these streets
Master of none, pastors and nuns
Let's bow our heads for the ceremony

[Pre-Chorus]
Jesus, please deliver us from evil
Please pray over all my people
What you see in life's illegal
I don't wanna use my desert eagle

[Chorus]
Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)
Pray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)
Didn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)

Welcome to the darker side of TA13OO
All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos
Take another step in the path that you choose

[Verse]
Gorgeous beautiful taboo, always with a lot on her mind
You giving me all of your stories in the littlest amount of time
You loving me is forbidden, loving you back is a crime
I wrote this poem for you, forever remain in my rhymes
I knew you wasn't normal ever since the age of nine
I, heard you were molested when you hit the age of five
So, in a sense I sensed that all your innocence had died
You, swallowing all of your pride, won't, let anybody inside
As you cry me a thousand lakes on my shoulder blade, I say
Everything's gonna be okay
I'ma hold tight 'til I see the next day with you
Stay with you, play with you, pray with you and pray to you
Curry killed the pussy hoping that I could kill the hate in you
Even if you don't wait for me, forever I will wait for you
Even if it's too late for me, forever I will wait for you
Watching your destiny fold in the grip of my palms
Paper planes being thrown on the side of the lawn, it said
[Chorus]
Welcome to the darker side of TA13OO
All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos
Take another step in the path that you choose
Make a bad choice in your path then you lose
Welcome to the darker side of TA13OO
All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos
Take another step in your path that you choose
Make a bad choice in your path then you lose

Knotty Head Lyrics[Intro: Rick Ross & Denzel Curry]
It's history right here (Tote a 4 and pour some liq')
Wassup my nigga? (I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen)
It's time to empower these niggas mane, do it for the city  (This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live)
We got to give it to them raw though, ya feel me? (Knotty headed niggas)

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Hair is nappy, knotty
Fuck karate, I got me a shotty
Jumpin' in the door, kamikaze
Origami if the neighbors saw me
But I won't fold, oh no
That's how the young boy's ass got smoked
But they got jacked like MK4
Sub-zero, put a nigga on salt, iced out
This the price I gotta pay because I wanna be iced out
Have them lookin' at my face as they tellin' me lights out
Sleep is the cause of the death, no a NY not my state of mind
211's broad day, I had to live a life of crime
[Pre-Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch I can't be touched
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Hair is nappy, knotty, pack a pistol when I'm in the party
Life is melancholy, sellin' flock when they think it's molly
Bitches be givin' me sloppy
My pockets on Andy Milonakis
Bumpin' Speaker Knockerz
Rico's Story when I see the coppers
Gem golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm-tree
Plus you know what a nigga's skin tone is, so that's why they fuck with me
Opposition we made obsolete when aimin' and targetin'
Monday to Sunday, all of you niggas, we slangin' like Pistol Pete, peace
[Pre-Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch I can't be touched
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live

Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live

It's your friendly neighborhood, I don't give a fuck! (Yeah!)
Get it straight, I innovate, you ad-libs on the 808
Don't need a tattoo on my face 'cause Denzel is a different race (Bitch!)
I don't even try to hate, I'm just sayin' what I ain't (Bitch!)
People sleeping on me hard and I'm the hardest in the paint
Eight years in the game and I never rode a wave (Nah!)
I may be overlooked, but I'm never underpaid (Nah!)
And when I win a Grammy I'ma take it back to Dade (Okay!)
You signing to a label where they treat you like a slave

On Tree, all of them niggas I birth, tryna put me in a hearse
On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs (What?!), I barely fuck with the Earth (Yeah!)
On me, industry niggas the worst (What?!), actin' like they from the dirt (Okay!)

SWITCH IT UP | ZWITCH 1T UP Lyrics[Chorus]
That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up
That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up
That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up
I'ma get money by any means, run it up

[Verse 1]
Uh huh, to be or not to be? (Huh)
Hamlet, I'm lit
If it ain't homicide, I don't commit
Y'all throw a fit when you don't got a fit
If you put out a hit
Bet you the killer ain't gon' make a cent
Bitch, it's a Miami nigga, no Moonlight
Let's take it back to the crib (Aah!)
One of my homies, he pull the gun on me
He turnin' cold on me like meet the maker
So super phony as if he don't know me
I see what they told me about the hater
And I wasn't even phased, in the hottest of the blaze
Talkin' 'bout a nigga changed with a pocket full of change
Brain disorder, blame this for the pain in Florida
Bipolar, vibe over, time slower I'm sober, now I sorta see (huh)
What is going on with me? (huh)
Gotta shout-out [censored] G
You did wrong, but it's done for the right
New friends, new flies they swarm to the light
Money and a new girl that's warm for the night
Do a hoe like clothes they worn for the night like
[Chorus]
That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up
That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up
That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up
I'ma get money by any means, run it up

[Verse 2]
Uh huh, how can I see through my lenses
When I can't see who my friend is, huh?
Wanna be down as dependent
Would you give up your appendix? (Huh?)
If life is hangin' by a thread (Whoo!)
Then a nigga just might be dead (Bah!)
If my life was in your hands (Bah!)
Now a nigga don't trust no man (Aah!)
Maybe I shoulda been shot on the day that it happened
When you started snappin' on me (Whoo!)
They only seen on one side
Now it's deeper than rap and a nigga move back to the 3 (Whoo!)
Get back good with the boys in my hood
'Cause it ain't about no other (Damn!)
I got new niggas tellin' these new niggas
That I don't fuck with my brother (God damn!)
They only know Denzel Curry (What?)
But they really don't know Denzel (Okay!)
Everybody wanna ride waves (Okay!)
And jump when the ship don't sail (Whoo!)
You did wrong, not done for the right
New friends, new flies, you flew to the light (flew to the light!)
Funny what these new niggas might do for the hype (do for the hype!)
Lesson learned, I'm goin' on through wit ya life like
[Chorus]
That nigga nice (that nigga nice!), that nigga mean, switch it up
That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up
That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up
I'ma get money by any means, run it up
That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up
That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up
That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up
I'ma get money by any means, run it up65Embed

WISH Lyrics[Intro]
Your wish is my command
I'm your genie
Your wish is my command
(He's heating up)
Can't you feel the magic?
(FnZ)
Oh damn

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Dreads to the top, gold in my mouth, woaday
Hoes by the flock, no, let me stop, woaday
And I keep a Glock, nah, it's a Glock .40
Hands on a knot, hands on your bop, woaday
She gon' bust it open for a nigga in designer
That's gon' be the reason why she let you get behind her
You might be the nigga that's gon' probably wine and dine her
I'ma take her home only usin' one-liners
[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Pull up in an navigator truck, Excursion
Bad bitch on the side of me, half Persian
I don't got a car, but I got car service
So many chains, make a, uh, feel nervous
Wait, I meant to say my chick from Nicaragua
Put her on the team 'cause we both makin' dollars
Hit her with the stroke, get her wet like aqua
If she was a bop, I would hit, then I'll drop her
Hang with the bros 'cause you know blood thicker
I miss my vros, so we pour more liquor
And you don't want smoke, you don't want no Swisher
'Cause you don't want war with a South Florida nigga
Miami-Dade on my motherfuckin' back
I'm Polo'd down to the socks to the nutsack
It's R.I.P. X and R.I.P. Tree
I'ma do it for my dawg, this for all of my G's

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Dreads to the top, gold in my mouth, woaday
Hoes by the flock, no, let me stop, woaday
And I keep a Glock, nah, it's a Glock .40
Hands on a knot, hands on your back, woaday
She gon' bust it open for a nigga in designer
That's gon' be the reason why she let you get behind her
You might be the nigga that's gon' probably wine and dine her
I'ma take her home only usin' one-liners
[Verse 2: Kiddo Marv]
Bossed up, came a long way from bein' a manager
Glocks up with the sticks and the clips lookin' like banana-na
Never pay for pussy, these bitches ain't gettin' nuh-uh
My name alone gon' make me press on your ho like a button
In my city ridin' vert to Uzi, Lil Uzi Vert
Every week another funeral, only time we go to church
Runnin' all these rappers down a check, they wanna splurge it
Step up in the scene, so fresh, so clean, like a detergent
Quick to cut a pussy nigga up just like a surgeon
I'ma need a Perky 'cause a young nigga be hurtin'
Slidin' like a Taliban with a turban
Pull up all black in a suburban
'Cause he ain't die, so we gotta slide back, Mike, Thriller
Pay my young nigga to get you whacked for five figures
They gon' rip him, flip him, cut his ass up
Put him in a box, and ship him, yup

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Dreads to the top, gold in my mouth, woaday
Hoes by the flock, no, let me stop, woaday
And I keep a Glock, nah, it's a Glock .40
Hands on a knot, hands on your back, woaday
She gon' bust it open for a nigga in designer
That's gon' be the reason why she let you get behind her
You might be the nigga that's gon' probably wine and dine her
I'ma take her home only usin' one-liners
[Outro]
Your wish is my command
Can't you feel the magic?
Your wish is my command
Can't you feel the magic?
Your wish is my command
I'm your genie14Embed

I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well

The P-O-P-E D-E-A-D, dead 'em, I do it professionally
Assassin's Creed, your majesty, the after is not happily
Her body in factories, my ugly life tragedy
I'm at yo' face, that's a Periscope, fuck a telescope
Careful my angel or higher hope, I desire rope, uh
I'm gonna live by my confidence, I'm gonna die by my arrogance
Heaven and hell is irrelevant, I be the black metal terrorist

I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell
