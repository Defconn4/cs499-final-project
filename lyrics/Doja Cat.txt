Say So Lyrics[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry
[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it bad
Take it, own it, steal it fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties
[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so111Embed

Kiss Me More Lyrics[Verse 1: Doja Cat]

And always just say goodnight (La-la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga (Feel like jail)
I can't even exhale, nigga (Exhale)
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on your—, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back

Drama make you feel (Make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

Umm, you could say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassin'
Ten-page text, shoulda wrote a book, coulda made a bag
But he broke and he still waitin' 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doin' too much, relax a bit
Actin' like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Shoulda known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative

I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga
Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga
I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fuckin' mom
You should have paid my rent, go get a fuckin' job

[Chorus: Doja Cat & Nicki Minaj]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Uh)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Every time I take a break, the game be so boring
Pretty like Naomi, Cassie, plus Lauren
Spittin' like Weezy, Foxy, plus Lauryn
Ball like the Rams, see, now that's Gordon
They don't understand the bag talk, I'm foreign
When they think they top the queen, they start fallin'
Word to my ass-shots, I'm so cheeky
Got 'em tryna palm my ass like young Keke
Yes, I'm ghetto, word to Geppetto
Plus I'm little, where's my stiletto?
Tell Mike Jordan send me my Retros
Used to be bi, but now I'm just hetero
Ain't talkin' medicine, but I made him more a fiend
Ever since I put the cookie on quarantine
He know this thing A1 like a felony
All he gotta do is say the word like a spelling bee
[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?

4 Morant (Better Luck Next Time) Lyrics[Intro]
The beach is a good place to pick up girls because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are- of chicks
And they’re-and they're-and they're-and they’re-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're
Hm, mm, mm

[Verse]
I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, I'd flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends that pretend, wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna spend shit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can’t handle rejection, stand my reflection
Damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind and remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I'm the ’shine once guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the streets, to the gutters, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say, "Mother never weep"
My brother finds blood
I say, "Shut up 'fore she sees"
Another motherfucking treat
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth
Spittin' natural disasters
God told me, "Cat, don't mess with the past tense"
You’re testing the masters
So guess what the fact is
My ex is a bachelor
Next, gonna get big checks from the sets
Next, from the dancers
Next, from the models
This Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles
Someone hexed all the bottles
I swear on my life, I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh
[Chorus]
Better luck next time
Be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time (Better luck next time)
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time

Streets Lyrics[Intro]
I've been goin' through some things (Oh)
I struggle with my inner man (Yeah, yeah)
I hustle, I'll do what I can to get this money
Blaq Tuxedo
Don Dada on the, Don Dada on the beat

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

[Post-Chorus]
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
[Verse 1]
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you
[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

[Post-Chorus]
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?120Embed

I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other

They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls

Mmm
I ain't tryna (Ah)
I ain't tryna
I ain't tryna

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop

You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew, 'cause they hope I choke

Don't need a report, don't need a press run
All of my bad pics been all my best ones

I am advanced, so I get advance
And I do my dance and cancel the plans
Said boo, don't be mad 'cause you had the chance
[Pre-Chorus]
Drop, said I took it and I ran for it
I won it, then I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, let them put a tan on it
Said I took it and I ran for it
I won it, then I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, let them put a tan on it like

You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' high for
Men that like to do the things to remain that guy who
Need someone who's sweet and not gon' shoot to make that high note

I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high

[Post-Chorus]
You get me so high, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high, high
[Verse]
You got me so turnt up
This dude gotta be so high
Weed always on my mind
Now he always on my mind
Doja...
Know you want some of this purr
You ain't gotta say a word
Just spark that let's get burnt, uh
Then we'll roll up
A hunnit fuckin' blunts
All up in my mouth
Now I'm all up in yo
This nigga got pounds of it
All up in his trunk
Now we both look Asian
He wavin' and I'm drunk
I got dank shit in my cup
You know what I'ma do to you
I could get real used to you
Blow, weed, X and we sipping on that juicy-juice
That's just what she choose to do, uh
Man, this shit these drugs will do to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Blow, weed, coke, pop X
Speeding up the heartbeat bangin' in my chest
When you put it on me you relieve my stress
You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths
[Chorus]
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high

[Post-Chorus]
You get me so high, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high, high

Freak Lyrics[Chorus]
Freak like me
You want a good girl that does bad things to you
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak
Do, do-do, do-do, do-do
Freak like me

[Verse 1]
Tied him down to my queen bed
Tease him just enough to hate me (Hate me)
Tied it tight enough, he can't break free (Break free)
Keep him waiting 'til he try
This can go one of two ways
We could flip the coin, I'll be your slave (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Call you daddy, give me a nickname (Ah)
I ain't afraid of a little pain (No, I ain't 'fraid of a little pain)
Yo, yo, yo, yo (Ah)
He wanted some'n else and he wanna be selfish
He wanted them three rounds, DC had to come help him
Look, I know your position
Try to squeeze in the full nelson though
Beat on it, beat, beat on it, mercy like a black belt give
Daddy the grand master, daddy, I want it faster
Them bitches you fuckin' with, I know they gon' need some practice
So bring 'em along wit' ya, I'll teach 'em how to smash ya
When I made a little mess on it, he told me to clean my act up
[Chorus]
Freak like me (Tryna freak you down)
You want a good girl that does bad things to you
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo (Like me)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 2]
Hey, I could take a big bat, bet that he thinkin' this a game
Hey, batter, batter swing, you could put it on a swing
Freak like a triple XXX flick, put her on a chain
This pussy off the chain, this kitty insane
I could fuck him in the rain, I could fuck him in the Range (Uh)
I could fuck him every day (Uh), I'ma fuck him 'til he sang (Uh)
Milkshake bring the boys to the yard, I'ma need the whipped cream
Ain't ever been vanilla, honey, just wait until you get a taste
Skirt off, fuck in the backseat
Take that shirt off, baby, put it on me
Got me like, "Yeehaw," ride it like a horsey
Kinda like see-saw, up and down on the D, give it to him

[Chorus]
Freak like me (Need a freak like me)
You want a good girl that does bad things to you (You want a good girl)
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak
Do, do-do, do-do, do-do (Now you need a freak)
Freak like me
Freak like me (You never, you never, you never been)
You want a good girl that does bad things to you
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak (You need a freak)
Do, do-do, do-do, do-do (You need a freak)
Freak like me (Like me, papa)
[Outro]
Babe, you never been with no one nastier than me
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me oh so tight
Show me that you love me too29Embed
