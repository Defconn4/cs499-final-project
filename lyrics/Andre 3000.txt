Me&My (To Bury Your Parents) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Me and my mother, driving to the grocery store
Me riding shotgun with my window rolled down
She smoked cigarettes and gets what she gets by
Hustling harder, rollers and a nightgown

[Verse 2]
Me and my father, driving to the football game
Me riding shotgun, my window rolled down
He sipped Cognac and kept us all laughing
I was much happier when he was around

[Bridge]
When he was around
When he was around
Around
[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Around
Around
Around
Me and my mother
Me and my father
Me and my—

Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby

[Verse 1]
Miss lady
You could have been born a little later but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs
Same here, and actually I think that's funky
(In a Claire Huxtable type way)
Miss lady
It looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
So call me when that big ole house gets lonelyfied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun
[Hook]
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby

You're sophisticated
Just me and miss lady
You've got me talkin like a baby
You make me talk baby talk
She's so sophisticated
You make me talk baby talk
Just me and miss lady
She makes me talk baby talk
Got me talkin like a baby

Chronomentrophobia (Movie Version) Lyrics[Intro]
Chronomentrophobia, the fear of clocks
The fear of time...

[Verse 1]
High's the cost of living
I take what I have been given
Pastor say, be strooong
Hooo yeahhhhahhh
I ain't' got tiiiime
Leave me aloone

[Bridge]
Ain't that much time left
I've got to funk you now
[Hook]
Chronomentrophobia (x8)

[Verse 2]
Lord, be havin' mercy on my soul
I'm havin' the impression that my life gonna be a bowl of cherries
But it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't' got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while ya'll made up yo beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I lay my head
Born in 1975
Never thought I'd make it this far
Still battlin' in this racial war
Tryin' to find solutions to the situation I'm facin'
Only thing that's free is my flow that yall be chasin'
Lettin' my niggas know before I go
I drop that knowledge like dropping books
Let's stop the crooks from robbing of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good
You enter my hood you won't be findin' much
Hope that when I'm gone ya'll remember this
What we stood for, fuck that fame and that glitz
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
Got to be more careful, know what corners you be bendin'
Revelations getting impatient
Now I'm dead
Remember what I said
I'm gone
Bow ya heads3Embed

Outkast Reunion Tour Jumpsuit Slogans Lyrics(Yin-Yang)
X
F#CK 3000

I pray there's a god at the end of all this

Life is short, take more baths
Children of the cornbread
I've never been to afrika
Sorry I forgot to call you back
Obviously oblivious
How good a friend are you
Big girls are beautiful to me
Fruit snack addict
Umm, you still on yo' pyramid?
Across cultures, darker people suffer most. why?

Ok, hand over the cure and stop playing

Art or fart?
I've never had f@ckbook, twitt@r, or inst@gram

Everything is temporary

Ninjas kill me

Breathe
Sloppy wet Poseidon
God. or god?

I love old people

Loners get lonely too

Narcissistic americans

Thinking deeply about shallow s#it

Passionate about compassion

Sleazy LyricsI dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Get sleazy
We started out so cute in our baby pictures
That mommy shot for our daddy so that he wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day hell remember
If not hes human, Im human, you human, well forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him
Hes such a cool a-s guy, then wonder why she date him
Im only 8, Im not old enough, guess its complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it dont get negated
I was gon save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but its the 19802s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin Irish Baileys
She say Stacks, youre true blue?
I said Nah, Im Navy
I call her Kesha, she like it, because its hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 cause Im good to her
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you or your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
You can't imagine the immensity of the f*ck Im not giving
About your money and man servant at the mansion you live in
And I dont wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just grab a bottle, some boys, and lets take it back to my basement
And get sleazy, sick of all your lines, so cheesy
Sorry daddy, but Im not that easy
Im not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it
Imma take it back to where my man and my girls is
Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, cause imma get
Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, cause imma get
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
I dont mean to critique on your seduction technique
But your moneys not impressing me, its kinda weak
That you really think youre gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off, by showing me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends, we dont buy bottles, we bring em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave em
And I dont care if you stare and you call us scummy
Cause we ain't after your affection, and sure as hell not your money, honey
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!

Back to Black Lyrics[Verse 1: André 3000]
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bed
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry - get on without your guy

And I, I, I went back to a anew
So far removed from all we've been through
Oh-oh-oh, and you and you and you
You tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I'd go back to her
And you go back to...
You go back to...
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I, I love you much - it's not enough
I love blowing you lovepuff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her

A Richer Shade Of Blue LyricsYou see all these people out here on this street, Eddie
See they got blues
I'm talking 'bout they poor
They broke, they hungry, that's blues

Well, the blues can live in Buckhead too
I know it's just a richer shade of blue
But it's still blue, I can feel it, listen

He got everything he want
But everything he need money don't buy
Now if that ain't blues I'll say listen, oh

They look at you
All they see is dollar sign
Now if that ain't blues I'll say listen
A rich shade of blue
Okay, okay, you snappin', you snappin'
A rich shade of blue
Well, I'm just playing what I feel and it sure feels good
A rich shade of blue

I see I'ma have to bring you down to Bankhead more often
'Cause you goin' off
A rich shade of blue
Or we can take it to Buckhead and do it Peachtree style
A rich shade of blue

Everybody fall down sometime, yeah, just like that
Oh, but you gotta get back to the place where they know your face
And they don't mind if you cry sometimes
They listen 'cause they cry too

Ooh, that's right, right, right
A rich shade of blue
I guess it ain't where you from, it's where you at
A rich shade of blue

It's my birthday and I'm having the best worst time of my life
A rich shade of blue
Man, we stand out on this corner any longer
You gon' make me rich

Hey Ya! - Single Version Lyrics[Intro: André 3000]
1, 2, 3, uh!

[Verse 1: André 3000]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

[Chorus: André 3000]
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
[Verse 2: André 3000]
You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is “Nothing is forever”
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

[Chorus: André 3000]
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want you in my Caddy (Uh-oh)

Don't want to meet your mama (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want to make you cumma (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh

Hey ya!

Hey, alright now, alright now, fellas (Yeah?)

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

[Refrain: André 3000]
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

[Bridge 2: André 3000]
Now all the Beyoncés and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

How would them babies learn their ABC's
Oh, no

No, 'Old McDonald Had A Farm'
And birds would have nothing to sing
No, 'Take Me Out To The Ball Game'

Life without music
This is terrible
(No, no, no)
Uh, we wouldn't even whistle
(No, no, no)
And we wouldn't have a heartbeat
'Cause we wouldn't know what a beat was

Life without music
That's so lame
(Life without music)
Man, we wouldn't even have no ring tones

Shawty the phone wouldn't even ring
(Life without music)
Uh, it would just vibrate

At least nobody will be able to download your songs

She's got a point
