My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (Hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (Ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (Yeh, yeh)

In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say, "You're the worst, you're the worst"
I cannot die because this my universe

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry

Don't really like her, we friends for the most
Cuban link tri-color, all on my choker (Skrrt)
Don't leave the crumb, got the bread, then you toast
If you start touchin' my gun, got no holst'
I put a coat on top of my coat
Only twenty minutes before the show (Show)

[Chorus]
I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town, never saw her before
Told her, "Baby, we don't got that long"
Listen, this not my city show, but, I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on (Yeah)
I am not slow, these girls just want me, 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend, give and go (What?)
He pass me her friend, so they switchin' roles (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
Damn, I just started it (Started), man, I just started it
Oh my God, please, do not bother me
Don't got enough just to order me (Yeah)
I'm on that tree like an ornament
Money so long like accordion (Woo)
You lied to me, wasn't sorry then
On the weekend, you was partyin'
It was just me, you was targetin' (Yeah)
It was just me, you was targetin' (Target)
Jump in the Porsche, I might target it (Skrr)
Jump in the Lamb', I ain't parkin' it (Skrr)
Ice is so cold, I snowboard in it (Blaow)
Go to my show, they applaud me in
She call my phone with emergency (Ayy)
She call my phone with that urgency (Ayy)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?" (Ayy)
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?", yeah
She said, "I need a new whip," yeah (Skrr)
"'Cause I know that you still ballin'" (Ball!)
She just wanna go back to the future, so, I brought that girl a DeLorean (Yah)
Twenty more minutes until I got' go, so, I told that girl that I'm gonna slaughter it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town, never saw her before
Told her, "Baby, we don't got that long"
Listen, this not my city show, but, I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on (Yeah)

P2 Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, I'm startin' over
Stackin' in it, it was the top, now are you alright?

I gotta keep my head high
I got a whole 'nother check, not talkin' verified (Okay)
Rest in peace my dead guys
I am no hater, yeah, we in the same whip
The only difference is that you do not own it (Skrrt, skrrt)
I can just tell by the way that you drivin' it
I pull up in that car just like it's stolen
Yeah, I came a long way, came from the hallway
I can't stop, keep goin'
Yes, my life just feel like one long day, I just live in the moment
Woah, ooh, comin' out just when the sun down
My boys, they ruthless like coupes and they really run down
I got paper cuts from hundred dollar bills covered in bustdowns
Countin' with my thumb now, money make me numb now

[Chorus]
I don't really care 'cause I'm done
On the real, our love is not fun (Yeah)
There's no emotion on my face 'cause I'm numb

I said, everything I said messin' with your head
Messin' with your head, woah, messin' with your head, woah
[Verse 2]
I just got richer overseas, yeah
Lookin' at my watch and it's a Richard and it's green, yeah

You wouldn't even believe the numbers stuffed up in my jeans, yeah
Tell that girl to back-back, gotta stack racks (Ayy)
No, I can't go out sad, can't go out bad, yeah
I told that girl I'm not no duck, this ain't Aflac, yeah
I don't wanna get older, I'm still livin' in my last year
I hope my life just keep goin', don't worry 'bout that
Just tighten up and keep flowin', cowabunga
She gon' ride me like wakeboard (Yeah)
I'm lickin' on her body until she don't make noise, yeah (Noise)

I don't really care 'cause I'm done
On the real, our love is not fun

Telepathic, fam watch how I read ya (Skateboard)

Success is a drug and man we high

Ain't you tired of enslavement? (Huh)
Come with us, make some paper (Ching)
Cause you should own what you labor
[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, you never stayed in Kailua (Hawaii)
I put Chanel on my shooter (Yeah)
Flooded my chain and it's Gucci
I don't want that girl, she moody (Facts)
I'm basically saying I'm cooler (Slatt)
Get Dior discounts from my cougar
Back in the sixth grade, I got them bad grades
I was in love with my tutor (Yeah)
See, musically, Lil Uzi trappin’, man
Most of you rappers be actors, man
Go M.I.A when I find little Madison
Stay at the Ritz-Carlton, this not the Radisson
Just took a blue one, ’bout to take the red pill
Purple thoughts in my brain, hope it don't spill
Stay with a nerd just like Urkel, Jaleel
Fresh just like Carlton, I kill ’em with Will
Big ass "R" on my Smiths
Big ass "R" on my whips
Slip-on shoes, so you won't trip
Said she kinda fine if she got some hips
Momma said, "Let me see the witch
Boy you know light and dark don't mix
Mix it up, boy, bad luck"
Sick to my stomach with them neon guts
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Lil Uzi Vert]
Higher than Elon Musk, so high stars eat our dust
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts
Dark energy, we don't touch, our jewelry’s beyond Tut
And it give a nigga colorful aura like I got neon guts
Higher than Elon Musk, so high stars eat our dust
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts
Dark energies, we don't touch, our jewelry's beyond Tut
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts

Yeah fam, Pharrell on Mars with my fellow star
I'm like lightning striking in a metal rod
I say, "Hello God" in the devil bars
So dammit, Amex, I got a yellow card

[Verse 4: Lil Uzi Vert]
C'mon, yellow card, yellow card
Damn, P, I need a yellow car
I am from the root like where the petal start
I had to push like a pedal start
Started way after but ahead of y'all
New crib, got a better yard
Two years, I got hella cars
Since the eighth grade I had hella broads
Hella broads, hella broads
Yellow painting with a yellow brush
Shit came from KAWS, probably marge
Slick my hair back like I'm Chico DeBarge (Ayy)
I got some lights on my chest (Yuh)
Don't confuse it with a heart (Mhm)
Heard things ain't looking too good for you
Had to pull some strings like I play the harp
I get these billions alone
It been that way from the start (Start)
Smoking good kush, my cologne
Got neon guts 'cause I can't see in the dark
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Lil Uzi Vert]
Higher than Elon Musk, so high stars eat our dust
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts
Dark energy, we don't touch, our jewelry's beyond Tut
And it give a nigga colorful aura like I got neon guts
Higher than Elon Musk, so high stars eat our dust
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts
Dark energies, we don't touch, our jewelry's beyond Tut

She was ridin' on my dick, she ain't need two pedals
I swear these niggas, they bitches
I swear they all gonna snitch when my niggas go shoot at 'em
Niggas, they mad about this
Niggas, they mad about that, but it's only if you let 'em
She save my name in her phone
Only thing she save me under is probably that "U" letter (Hello?)
No, I don't got provolone
Only thing in my pocket is probably, um, some blue cheddar
She tried to leave me alone
Then she got right with my clone, man, I hope that she do better
I know it's blue cheese on me
But when I got fifties on me, I call that shit loose cheddar (Hah)
Jeremy Scotts all on my feet

I can make it rain like no matter what's the weather (Facts)

They try to cut me down when they say I'm too low, woah, uh (Turn me up)

Do what I want, I'ma bend your rules (Woah)

I ain't ever been no type that lose, yeah
Born like this, I ain't did no study
Everything I got, man, I got it in a hurry
If I love you, better say that you love me
And if I trust you, better say that you trust me
Talk 'bout the bag, the mula, the guap
I'm at the bank, only time that I'm runnin'
I said I'm on the road, no, I cannot stop
I'm runnin' through obstacles, I'm in a hurry
Woah, stop that
Told a fuck nigga just drop that (Yeah)
If you shoot first, we gon' pop back

Sanguine Paradise Lyrics[Intro]
We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass (I'm working on dying), do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Verse 1]
If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you could buy ho
But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door
So you can hear her hit the high note
[Bridge]
I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Foreign girls and they 10s, I can't choose
Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise

[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin' and my doors suicide

[Verse 2]
Side note, you will never reach my goals (At all)
I be walkin' with a slime nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side ho
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talkin' to my little slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality, I'm 5'4"
Stand on my money, now I'm 6'6"
Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aimin' at his top, boy you need a mop
Man, I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes, I am a dog, I don't do this shit for no image
All my diamonds, they be hittin' hard
Try to play me boy, that's a scrimmage
[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be riding and my doors suicide

[Verse 3]
Live it up, you can just go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Got frost on my diamonds, I'm gettin' the cake now
Now stay on your stomach, lil' bitch, when you lay down
Live it up, 'cause you can go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach, lil' bitch, better lay down
I'm so up and I can't turn it down
They counted me out, my whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds, you know I got rinse it
Know my boys comin', you know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for, already spent it
When I’m on the beat man, you know I'm gon' kill it
[Refrain]
We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass, do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be riding and my doors suicide

You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)

I had to count my money on the ironing board
I just took that bitch shoppin', fucked behind the stores

[Verse 2]
I had to get all my niggas off bond, I had to get 'em off holding (Yeah)
I had to take 12 right on the mile, drive it like my van was stolen (Skrrt, skrrt)
It sing like my birthday, brand new
'Cause I'm only known just to floor it (Brand new)
Yeah, I just know they be watchin' it
Yeah, I just, yeah, I just know they be watchin' it
All these hoes love me
I am such a slimy guy, nigga, do not trust me
Baby, I'ma bust you way before you bust me
You shouldn't have trusted me, girl, you got off lucky (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If it's beef, don't partake
No, I do not eat steak (Yeah)
All I eat is fish plates
My diamonds so cold, in the freezer, my wrist be
Somewhere in the hills, prolly where my bitch stay
Switchin' my crib and you know I'm gon' switch states (Yeah)
I made a million, yeah, off a mixtape
I made a million, yeah, off a mixtape
[Chorus]
I turned to an addict, I bought me a Patek
I bought her a baby one
Yeah, I brought me a Maybach, it came with two doors
Yeah, that's the Mercedes one
I stay with the baddest, I'm countin' the cabbage
While makin' my lady cum (I stay with the baddest)
I bought a G-Wagen, that shit was the BRABUS
That's why I be racin' 'em (I bought a G-Wagen)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war (Yeah)
I ain't fuck a bitch in so long, I'd do it in a Honda Accord (Woah)
I had to count my money on the ironing board (Yeah)
I just took that bitch shoppin', fucked behind the stores (Store)

[Outro]
Fucked behind the stores
You know that I gotta keep it real, fucked behind the stores (Sure)
You know that I gotta keep it real, fucked behind the stores
Yeah, count up a half a mil' up behind the store
Yeah, she gone off that molly like she ain't never take a pill before
You act like you tough like your homie ain't ever get killed before
What the...
Yo, what the fuck was that?65Embed
