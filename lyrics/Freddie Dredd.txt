Cha Cha Lyrics[Refrain: Lisa Ono]
Noite de luar, a brisa feito o mar
Eu no teu olhar, uma estrela no céu
Sinto seu desejo ao querer o meu beijo
E na hula uma lua de mel, de mel
Danço a hula huki e o cha-cha-cha
Sou estrela no céu
Vem tocar meu corpo sensual
Quero ouvir você chamar
Danço a hula huki e o cha-cha-cha
Sou estrela no céu
Vem tocar meu corpo sensual
Quero ouvir você chamar

[Chorus: Freddie Dredd & Lisa Ono]
Damn, son
These bitches want some
"Hey, Freddie, can I, umm?"
No, bitch, you fucking dumb (Noite)
Damn, son
These bitches want some
"Hey, Freddie, can I, umm?"
No, bitch, you fucking dumb
[Verse: Freddie Dredd & Lisa Ono]
Hello⁠—Hello, bitch, what you want?
Hittin' up my phone up on some bullshit, huh?
Think I give a damn about stealing your ’gram?
Bitch, I'm gonna rob you, bitch, I'm on a mission (Noite)
Don’t wanna suck? Then I don't give a fuck
Run your shit, slut, then get my nut
Better not be in the streets
Run up on me, hear a "bap, bap" then a screech (Noite)
I don't mean to hurt you
But I need more money
Kinda funny how the Freddie
Run upon you, you a dummy (Noite)
Uh oh, I think I gotta go
Big bitch, what you wanna know?
Made a hit though, kick the back do'
Big blast made a flash hole, hole (Noit⁠—)

GTG Lyrics[Intro: Freddie Dredd & Juicy J]
Come on, baby, let's go get another fucking stain
Beat them- beat them with the chain, feelin' good up in the rain
Thera- therapy, I'll be killing bitches 'til the end of me
Choking on your words, tell you when it's gonna hurt
I'ma break your heart, Freddie gonna make you fuckin' split apart
What the fuck was that, Fredd-?
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, bitch

[Verse: Freddie Dredd]
Consequences heavy, are you bitches ready?
Step into my Chevy, aimin' very steady
Calm down, you ain't scared now
You accept your fate, you can't relate, you bow down
Stop that bitchin' shit, you never know who got the clip
Aimin' at your head, dead, gonna put your ass to bed
Night, night, bitch, you's a light bitch
Freddie bright, bitch, murk a fuckin' snitch
Rest in peace, mane, take a load off
Cold in your damn grave, I think I got a cough
Shit, I'm sick, I got it from your blood
These bitches always try to fuck with me, I'm in the mud
Let's try to sort that out, I promise you I will go easy
Your carcass fuckin' freezing, trickin' you, it was so easy
I don't want a bitch or a ho, I think you just gotta go
Meet me at the corner store, gonna leave you wantin' more
Little suckers always comin' up to me
What you tryna say, you little bitch? I'll end your day
I don't want a bitch or a ho, I think you just gotta go
Meet me at the corner store, gonna leave you wantin' more
Little suckers always comin' up to me
What you tryna say, you little bitch? I'll end your day21Embed

Murder once you feel alive
If you know I got it, come and get it
Come back with the heat, bitch you better get ready
Your big bitch is scared
Shaking like you ain't aware
Smoking hella strong, you can smell it in my hair
I will never stop, smoking dope
Gives me fucking hope
Can you come and guess?
Bitches flex
Ain't no fucking test
Goin' down south
With the blunt in my mouth
I just copped a one way
Leave today, it ain't the same
Why the fuck you tryna play?
I ain't playing any games
I'm just struggling all alone
Do not try to hit my phone
Players running knuckle up
'Bout to test my fucking nuts
Stab 'em once or stab 'em twice
Murder is so fucking nice

Give it up now, give it up or else you gonna drown

Think of all this devil shit, test the Freddie damn that's it

Why you hate? Look at this you goofy, you a fuckin' fake
Goin' through the jungle, I will end you with the fucking rake
My nerves, are tingling
Got the thrill, it's sickening
The blood, it's in my hair I don't really give a care
I will never turn it in
Carcass rottin' in the bin
Feel the ghost, you shiverin'
Devil lookin' over them
Think of evil not today
Can you please just go away?
Sniffin' beans and smokin' dope, only way these bitches cope

Hello, I'm Bob Ross
And I'd like to welcome you to the 20th Joy of Painting series
Son-of-a gun, it's hard for me to believe this is the 20th series
But it, it is and I'd like to thank you very much for inviting me back
For another series of paint-

Once was a killer
And I got to butcher crips
Run up in your shit
Gonna let you take a dip
In my evil fantasy
Won't you run and come with me
To the deep, deep part of
More than you can see
I'm a ghost, I'm a demon
And I'm seekin' when you're dreamin'
For a new cause
Hit the pause
Lookin' for a new job
Wake up with the bed
While you pussies try to slay
I'm the Freddie mayne
Fuck the game
Looking for a new bang
Oh shit
What the hell you talkin' bout bitch?
It's the new way
Freddie made
Bout to make a separate lane
[Chorus]
Oh my god you's a bitch motherfucker
Why you try to play me like a bitch motherfucker?

Hold this bust of indica
Bout to come and fuck it up

And you know I'm 'bout to bust

Hope Lyrics[Verse 1: Freddie Dredd]
Fuck with me
No, you don't
Freddie gonna let you hoe
That's the hope and fuck a dope
Now go along and tie that rope
Hanging with your buddies
Hoping everything goes right
Then you pull that trigger thing
Kill him cause he know my name
Here's a lesson
Don't be testing
Or you'll meet my Smith & Wesson
Bustin' with some perfect aim
I watch it go right through your brain
Oh, you think you know Kaine?
Rollin' in the beamer thing
Killin' ain't a damn shame
Come on up and bring the pain
Roll up some dope
Bitch you know I cannot cope
With these evil thoughts
In the dark
Kill you from a-fuckin'-far
You's a bitch you make it easy
Killing you only to please me
It's a fuckin' homicide, now put the Glock up to your eyes
[Verse 2: Kaine]
Fuckin' with the playa mane
Load the Glock, go insane
Strollin' in the fuckin' rain
Lookin' for a damn stain
See me in the alley creep
Taste of death is just as sweet
Flaya offs, follow me
Blueish fire after me
Fuck what you fuckin' speak
Get this feeling out of me
Violent death is what you seek
Breathing slow
Take a note
Fuck a suicide hoe
Bury you alive hoe
We don't choose sides hoe
Clout ain't what I'm looking for
Rippin' the pieces
I got my bitches on leashes
And for that Glock, I am reachin'
Murderer season is peakin'
I'm fillin' up with a vengeance
I kill them off like a sentence
Killer Kaine be the menace, and I break off the tension7Embed

K.O Lyrics[Verse 1: Freddie Dredd]
Hoe no we better go
All I get you very slow
Creeping in the back
As I creep up to a bat
Bash it in your fucking skull
Feel the brains and it's so cold
Cole that's my fucking soul
I have been to once before
One two many times I got you talking of my life
Bitch you better go away before I fucking lose my mind
And I don't want to do anything I'll regret
Think about it that's a blade slice you in a fucking neck
Who are you to say that I am wrong and you were right
But that's okay 'cause you put up a fight
Anyone who trying to test me gonna put you in a dirt
Leave your body fucking hurt wash the blood off your sword
[Pre-Verse: Freddie Dredd]
That's okay 'cause you put up a fight
Cause you put up a fight
Cause you put up a fight

I’m a Murderer LyricsDoomshop, motherfucker!

I'mma kill a busta motherfucker with a Glock
Have a fucking heart attack
I don't give a motherfuck about any other shit
Take the shot, hold that thought, now I'mma let that rock
I'm just chillin' with the crew, we fuck around, that's how we do
And we fuck with the life
Fuckin' with the sheriff's wife
Put her down in the dirt
Leave her buried, then she squirt
Plain and simple, then we dip
I ain't playin' with this shit

I'm a motherfuckin' murderer, a motherfuckin' murderer
I'll motherfuckin' murder her
I can't remember, it's a blur
What the fuck you sayin' hoe?
I never ever heard you, but I hurt you or I burn you
Fucking choose, you gonna lose
Check the time, I'll blow your mind
You'll never see it coming
I'm becoming evil every day
A motherfucker stay away
Pop you off then watch you drop at 5:05 am
Take a fuckin' sip of gin
Pull the trigger say, "the end"

[Verse 2]
I feel so mothafuckin' sick from the murders that I do
Blood streamin' down your neck, as I grip up to the Tec
Head poundin' like the pigs at yo' motherfuckin' door
No questions will be asked because you're a stupid whore
Find yo' mothafuckin' body mutilated in the sea
Floatin' like a fuckin' trout, blood all spread out
You think there's recovery?
Bitch, you do not want to know me, F-R-E-D death is me
Feel me creepin' on yo' street
Body so sore from the bullshit I endure
Demons poisoning your mind, made you picture yo' demise
Say goodbye to yo' life because it will end so fast
Motherfuckin' hit the gas, 'cause your carcass will not last
Hit the motherfuckin' place, such a motherfuckin' shame
You will not look the same
Once again, I'll tell you mane
I will kill you, not for play
Just for pleasure, that's so sane
I can not ask anymo', shut the fuck up, hit the flo'6Embed

Devine Lyrics[Intro: Genshin]
Genshin, go back to hell

[Verse]
More and more
You better hit the floor
As I bust in your room
Looking like a fucking loon
.45 in your face
As I send you up to space
Any place but here
I don't like the atmosphere
Can't control, simple fate
Oh, you think you can relate?
What I put on my plate
Try to match my murder rate
But you can't hear a chant
Of my motherfucking name
Can you beat the fucking fame?
Watch your brother die in vein
Oh shit, you gon' dip
Gonna make you fucking quit
Fill my clip, hollow tips
Gonna throw a fucking fit
Cannot stop, hear the drop
Of my motherfucking case
See my face, no trace
'Boutta end the human race
Better keep your mouth shut
Or you're gonna know what's up
Gettin' bucked, what the fuck
Why you acting like you struck?
Looking down the barrel
What the fuck you think you gonna do?
Past to waste, you're fucking mine
Pull the trigger keep align

[Hook x5]
Motherfucker, ever wonder why I'm so divine?
I just keep it real, I'm packing steel
I need that .45
Put the Glock to your head
Can you hear what I just said?
Shut the fuck up, motherfucker
Watch you bleed, I'm undercover4Embed

ON ME LyricsDoomshop Mothafucka!

[Verse 1]
Hello- hello mothafucka'
I'mma tell you what is good
I'mma make you eat the dirt
Why does my neck hurt?
I'm so supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
I don't think you'll notice that you're gone; Hocus Pocus
Call me David Blaine, I am so damn insane
I am fuckin' with your brain, I ain't never ever lame
Just the same player mane in the mothafuckin' game
It's a shame that you blame every fool in here today
Stop, drop and roll, everybody pay the toll
In the know, got to go
Freaky bitches on the show
It's a curse, I ain't first
Put a body in a hearse, swervin' back 'n forth in the middle of the north
[Verse 2]
And you know I got that toolie on me
Freddie call you out when you a phony
You ain't foolin' nobody with that dollar sign up on ya'
I'mma bust your ass so fuckin' fast you cannot tell what will come next
I'mma tell her what is good when she creep up in my hood
Smokin' weed, smokin' dank, sold that bitch I make that bank
Kill a real bitch, you know I don't give a shit
Freddie runnin' through your cut, 'boutta fuck you up a lot

[Outro]
And you know I got that toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me, toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me, toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me, toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me, toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me, toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me, toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me, toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me, toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me, toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me
And you know I got that toolie on me, toolie on me4Embed

ENDLESS SEA Lyrics[Intro: Lisa Ono]
When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand
Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone
Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

[Verse 1]
Evilous massacre I am the master
Come from the underground causing disaster
Nothing is stopping me
You are my offering
Kill your whole family, even your offspring
Silent the evening, looks are deceiving
When Freddie comes creeping he'll stop you from breathing
Dearly departed it's murdering season
I cut your heart out and leave it there beating
[Bridge]
Silent night
There's no light
Freddie lurks
Out of sight
Got you stranded - big surprise
No you can't believe your eyes
Silent night
There's no light
Freddie lurks
Out of sight
Caught you in your web of lies
Got you screamin' for your life

[Verse 2]
You thought I was done but I still have full stamina
Bitch do not fuck with me, you are an amateur
Caught you red-handed like you are on camera
Time for another cold-killing in Canada
I am the Freddie Mayne
Shout out my family, DOOMSHOP is my infantry
Smoking my cavalry
Killing you quickly, so swiftly it's sickening
Crippling leads to my gun repositioning
Watch 'em disperse, you set up my curse
Beggin' for mercy, you snuck in my hearse
You stuck in my trunk, I'll bring you the phonk
I'm moving the elbows of OG and Skunk
Smokey is with me, it's time to make history
Fuck all these rappers I'm claiming my victory
Rock with the ones yeah, bitch, fuck the world
You know it is up 'cause it's causing the cold
[Outro: Lisa Ono] [x3]
Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone3Embed

Darko Lyrics[Intro]
Got a badass bitch and I just got the baddest Glock
Cocked it back one time and now your bitch is on my cock
Got you body cold I'm gonna lock the cellar door
Dark like Darko, I'm so psycho, what is going on

[Verse]
I-I-I-I-I'm the one who gonna tell you what the fuck to do
Swing the axe so fast it's gonna split your head to two
Beated up this beat is fucked, you better fucking run
Pull out the Gat then let it splat; the blood it taste like rum
Steppin' out the function, I see double, ain't no trouble
All I do is stumble, can you hear me fuckin' mumble?
I just got the plan so it's sticking on my mind
You so weak, I hear you speak, I see it in your eyes
Can you tell that Freddie's pacing? You gon' meet demise
I can't deny what this imply that you gon' fucking die
Runnin' out of breath, I think it's just gon' take some time
Take a look back at your motherfucking life (fuckin li-)
[Hook]
Got a badass bitch and I just got the baddest Glock
Cocked it back one time and now your bitch is on my cock
Got you body cold I'm gonna lock the cellar door
Dark like Darko, I'm so psycho, what is going on
Got a badass bitch and I just got the baddest Glock
Cocked it back one time and now your bitch is on my cock
Got you body cold I'm gonna lock the cellar door
