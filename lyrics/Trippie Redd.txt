DJ Flippp, make the money flip
Ooh, ayy
14, 14, 14, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
In rack city counting up the four
I was trapping, getting it by my 'lone
Rocket got them pints for the low
Chris got the rocket, he gon' blow
Murder what she wrote
We came through and took her soul
She want that dick then she get boned
Rack city blowing dope, bitch
She off the molly and the coke (Coke), bitch
You wan' touch then you get poked (Poked), bitch
Run my hood like the pope (Pope), bitch
[Verse 2: FOREVER ANTi PoP & Trippie Redd]
They thought I was dead but I'm still alive
I just needed time to relax, bitch
I just needed time, now I'm back, bitch
The money coming faster than it ever did
Please play this at my funeral
If I die tomorrow, tell my mama that I'm sorry for the life I chose
But this the life I chose
Mama, I'm sorry
This is the life for me
Nobody loves me but me
Nobody loves me but me
I fucked my girl last week
Told her get on her knees
Then she sucked on my D
Then that bitch hit the streets, she ain't fuckin' with me

[Interlude: Trippie Redd & FOREVER ANTi PoP & Chris King]
No more, no more, no more, no more

No more, no more, no more, no more (Snotty, blatt)

[Verse 3: Chris King]
I see more tombstones than the undertaker (Yeah)
And if we fuck now we can't cuddle later
The chopper make roaches scatter, fuck a huddle breaker
This MAC, I aim it at your face, I cannot make up
Brrat, I got them pounds and that ain't from Jamaica
Smoke, this thing I'm shooting fuck up God's creation
Ah, you the best, who am I replacing?
Woah, oh, that's a vest? Well it's your mind I'm aimed at
Scars of love from warfare with automatics
Bullets burn like lava, chopper spitting volcanic
Codeine and Percocets, spend a kidney and a liver
Stupid bitch fuck me over, I get it, I still miss her, woah

Leray Lyrics[Intro]
Good to now be here
It was love at first sight and misery after two months
Always feeling fucked up either by love or no love
"I thought you was married to the single life", she said
I wasn't necessarily looking for happiness, just less pain
I should've said somethin'
You said the only thing wrong with money is you ain't have enough of it
You said you deserve better, and now so do I
Anyways, the best part of us was me
When you got with me, you were a genius
Now without me, you have to live life as an idiot
I don't write songs, I write life, I told you that
And you were only fuckin' with my feelings because you didn't know your own
I do miss who I thought you were
And sometimes I'm miserable without you
So it's just like you're still here, shit
[Verse]
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart, yeah24Embed
