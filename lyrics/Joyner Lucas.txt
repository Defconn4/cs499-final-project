Isis Lyrics[Intro]
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus
Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for the homies in the chow hall (Whoa)
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Kidnap a nigga like ISIS (Whoa)
Turn a whole world to a crisis (Whoa)
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this (Boop, boop)
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh (Woo!)
Beat the police with a nightstick (Boop)
In my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk (Woo! Whoa)
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out (Whoa)
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house (Whoa)
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch (Whoa)
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out (Whoa)
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow (Whoa)
Errybody dissin' just to have clout (Whoa)
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? (Whoa)
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
I been livin' in the dungeon
I done held a couple grudges
Went to hell and got abducted
Meet the devil, I'm his cousin
I ain't settlin' for nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' (Bop)
Even Stevie Wonder could've see it comin' (Brrrap, brap, bop)
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven (Bop, bop, brrrap, brap)
But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? (Woo!)
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties (Whoa)
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine (Joyner)
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time (Woo!)
We do not share the same bloodline (No)
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time (Woo!)
[Interlude]
According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore (Whoa)
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for them days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit
That never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, then you blast
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo!
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS (ISIS)
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit (Body this shit)
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis
You Kelly, you pussy, you pussy
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton
You at Target with your mom
On the internet still hatin' on my last post (I hate this nigga)
I just sent a steak back at Mastro's, my god
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin
And 5'9" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we sealed the game's doom
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo!
[Chorus: Logic]
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo!

[Outro]

I’m Sorry Lyrics[Verse 1]
Go ahead and call me a coward
Say that I'm not strong because I'm not like you
Go ahead and call me crazy
'Cause I live in a maze, tell me how about you?
I think I live in my head
Sometimes I think that I'm dead, I hide behind my youth
Know I been losing my mind
And I'm a little behind, step inside my shoes
'Cause I've never been happy with myself
And I don't need no one feeling bad for me
Tryna to offer me pity and throw jabs at me
Wanna give me advice and then laugh at me
Behind closed doors, just close the door
Let me be by myself—just me and myself
I'm tired of living, I cry
I hear it's easy to die, I wanna see for myself
And I know that sounds crazy to everyone else
But I'm depressed as fuck, stressed as fuck
Ain't no medicine that could cure what's the test as drugs
I mean, I need extra love
And that ain't even enough, said that ain't even enough
And where the fuck is God? (God, God)
Damn, maybe I ain't believing enough
But today, we gonna see if he's real
And if He is, then I guess I'm prolly going to hell
Look, I ain't wanna die like this
I ain't picture my life like this
They don't know what it's like like this
Pretending I'm happy so I can smile like this, and laugh like you
Sometimes I wonder if I ever act like you
Could I finally fit in and maybe relax like, "Woo!"
Or would you feel lost without me?
'Cause honestly, I think the world is better off without me
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is I don't care how they feel about my feelings
I made up my mind, I'm going out like Robin Williams
I guess I'm not the Ordinary People of John Legend
And I've been suicidal since the day I was nine, shit
Okay, the day I was nine
I've been tired of being bullied, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told me I should take it one day at a time
And dammit, look at me now, fuck
Fuck, pen runnin' out, shit, fu—, ugh
Look, just know it's a new day
But if you reading this, then it's prolly too late, blaow!
[Chorus]
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me

[Verse 2]
I hope you got what you wanted
I hope you finally happy, it's too late for you
Been going out of my mind
You don't know how many times that I done prayed for you
I hope you hear me, goddammit
'Cause I got so much shit that I wanna say to you
I used to shine, now I'm all in the dark
I remember I used to tell you to follow your heart
But goddammit, look at you now, it's all of your fault
How could you? Maybe it's my fault
I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin'
Maybe I should have been more of an influence
I can't believe that you're dead, I fu–
I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it
But I'll forever be attached to you (Damn)
Part of me feels bad for you
A part of me feels like you weak and I'm mad at you
And I don't mean to be insensitive
But I don't understand how we couldn't prevent this shit
You took the easy way out, goddammit, you did
I mean, look what you did, I'm so fucking upset
How could you be so selfish?
Nigga, how could you be so selfish?
Now you're gone, you done left me so helpless
I wonder what God thinks, I hope you in God's place behaving yourself
Yo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself? (Say for yourself)
Look, I really feel lost without you
I hate the fact you think the world is better off without you
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is: I don't care how you feel about my feelings
And I'd be lying to you if I told you I'm fine, listen
I know that you can hear me, all I need is like five minutes
I just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out
I'm sorry this is something that we both couldn't figure out
I wish I could hear you now, is your soul missing?
I wonder if you could do it again, would you do it different?
Tell me what death is like
Was it meant for you, brodie? Did the heaven support it?
Are you fucking happy now? Did you get what you wanted?
Isn't this what you wanted? I feel the temperature falling
And you've been suicidal back then you were nine?
Yeah, even back then, you was nine
We was living on the edge, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told us we should take it one day at a time
And damn it, look at you now, shit
But it's a new day
And if you can't hear me, it's probably too late, fuck!
[Chorus]
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me91Embed

I’m Not Racist Lyrics[Verse 1]
With all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin', "Black Lives Matter"
All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin', "Nigga," this, and, "Nigga," that
Call everybody, "Nigga," and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, "Nigga," then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
"They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom"
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear
[Verse 2]
With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, "All Lives Matter," is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, "Nigga," is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
[Outro]
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
I'm not racist168Embed

I always been myself, you don't know me (Woah)
Yeah I was so depressed, I was lonely
The man on the horse, all I had was Ralph Lauren
Then I went and signed a deal and bought a pony (Woah)
Yeah I'm taking it back and then I'm smacking you bitches and laughing
And I'm killing them, hacking them, and sending your body right back to them
You wonder what's happening

Couldn't get a buzz even if you had lightyear
Wouldn't get no love even if your heart's right here
Niggas got guns so nobody want to fight fair, no
Hit 'em with the Ric Flair and the suplex
I ain't never been scared, bitch, I'm ruthless (Woo)
Raised by the ghetto
Know some gangs that'll get 'em
Split 'em right down the middle like a fuckin' duplex
Break a nigga toes, make 'em do the two-step
Crib full of hoes, now I feel like Hugh Hef
Got a bad stripper bitch, all we do is have sex
And she love suckin' dick so I call her loose neck (Woah)
Makin' a panic with my shit and I'm flippin' up banisters
I'm ready to handle and dismantle and crush and vanish
I hit 'em and send 'em into walls, then I got 'em enchanted
Then my fuckin hands that holdin the hammer bangin' and slammin'
Killin' 'em in the ambulance, they dyin', they bleedin', they tremblin'
I'm really sick and I got a stiff as a fuckin' mannequin
I paint a picture a Picasso vision, all on my cellophane
I got 'em swingin' they on my dick and grabbin my pants again
Now, uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco (Cinco)
I ain't Spanish but I know the lingo (Lingo)
Atlantic told me that my flow a hundred
But my album ain't come unless I got a fuckin' single
Well I don't give a fuck about no hit record

I'ma just murder every mother fucking beat while I'm dreaming of gettin' paid in my mother fuckin' sleep, goddamn
[Chorus]
Gucci gang, Louis gang, Fendi gang, Dolce gang

Bank Account (Remix) Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm willing to die for this shit
I'm ready to flip it and end up in prison the rest of my life for this shit
So my momma ain't want me, she got an abortion
I end up surviving this shit
And if I wanted somethin', I ain't got the money
I'd probably be robbing and shit
Don't know how much I cry for this shit
Said I am willing to ride for this shit
You know murder's my hobby, inside of my closet's a bunch of dead bodies and shit
Niggas say that I'm cursed 'cause I go to church and stare at the Bible and shit
Shawty say I'm the worst cause I do my dirt, and I don't be hiding this shit

[Verse]
Bitch, I'm a savage I spit at you bastards, I wonder what you gonna do to me, ho
I need to hear some more rapping
I'm just not impressed by your cash or your jewelry, ho
All you my soldiers and I'm a lieutenant
Goddammit, you should be saluting me, ho
I hope you know I ain't going nowhere
All you rappers just better get used to me, ho
Nigga, I'm Mr. Blue with my jeans, bought me a Jeep, 'cause I wasn't riding as much
My bank account looking weak, don't look at me, I ain't got time for no fun
Starting to feel like Tyrese, I'm 'bout to trip, and maybe start crying or som'
I might just hit up the Smith's, throw me a fit and wait for my wire to come
Ain't nobody give or show me love when I was coming up, I had to double up and tell these niggas buckle up before they ride
And they don't really wanna knuckle up, I hit 'em with the uppercut, I had these motherfuckers running for they life
Unidentified craft when I'm flying past, I'm an alien sailin' and if you look up in the sky
Blow your mind back, put your eyes back to your iPad, I'm an Iraqi in suicide
When the bombs are loaded and your mind explode in the wind
And you gon' sit down, repent
I was raised in the sewer; me and the 𝘐𝘵 clown are friends
Red balloons for your kids, sink my tooth in ya bitch
I lost too many friends, I don't do good with kids
What you know about riding dirty in the evening?
What you know about Ramen Noodles, and a pack of sazon seasoning
What you know about leaving the oven door open when there's no heat again
And the rent is due and your landlord try and throw you out on the streets again
Nigga, I was always dreaming of a Bentley and a fucking Lamborghini when I win 'em, I'ma finally get a break
If I didn't get it way before, I guarantee that if I talk to God, then I can say I got it when I prayed
She don't really want me to get petty, turn a dime into a penny, but she know I got a lot of shit to say
I can turn some water into Henny, drink it up and let the semi shoot, I'll pop you niggas all up in the face
Blood all up in the lake, I
Wanna see your wake die
They don't wanna wave bye
Creep when I came by, teeth like a canine
Bleed through your Levi, we from the East Side
Eat when the beat's hot, tea from the teapot
Aim for the tree top, beg till your knees pop
Skrrt in a Nissan, swerve into three cars
You just a bird in a beehive, you just a cold in a room full of germs
Nigga, I said all of my idols and favorite rappers ain't been rhyming a lot
What the fuck happened to Jay Electronica? I wonder if he still got it or not
What ever happened to eLZhi?
What ever happened to Meth? What happened to Beans? What ever happened to Lauryn?
What happened to Banks? Tell me what happened to Bleek?
What the fuck happened to Mos? What happened to Missy?
Nigga, what happened to Ghost?
What ever happened to Cube?
What up with Common? What the fuck, where did they go?
Tell me what happened to Budden's, what about Luda?
I hope they ain't losing it now
Hope they get back to the music 'cause I need some new shit
I'm sick of these new niggas out, I'm that new nigga now
[Bridge]
I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Nine niggas wanna war, 10 niggas on the floor, 11 niggas on the porch
12 killers wanna war, 13 carnivores, 14 Labradors, 15 dinosaurs, 16 Avatars
17 bombs or grenades at your rental car, 18 ways you can die when you have it all
I got I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Nine bitches wanna fuck, 10 niggas wanna rush, 11 hitters on a bus
12 think they one of us, 13 other guns, 14 runners-up, 15 rubber gloves, 16 double pumps
17 shots in your face till you cuddle up, 18 ways you can die tryna fuck with us

[Chorus]
I'm willing to die for this shit
Said I'm ready to flip it and end up in prison the rest of my life for this shit
And my momma ain't want me, she got an abortion
I end up surviving this shit
Shit if I wanted somethin', I ain't got the money
I'll probably be robbing this shit
Don't know how much I cry for this shit
Said I am willing to die for this shit
You know murder's my hobby, inside of my closet's a bunch of dead bodies and shit
Niggas say that I'm cursed 'cause I go to church and stare at the Bible and shit
Shawty say I'm the worst cause I do my dirt, and I don't be hiding this shit
Joyner, wooh!53Embed

Devil’s Work Lyrics[Intro]
Father, forgive me

[Verse]
I'm staring at this Bible as I keep glancing
Dear Lord, I got questions and I need answers
Tryna understand your vision, all I see is damage
Just a bunch of dead bodies in the street camping
A bunch of lost souls on their feet standing
We supposed to be your children, I thought we family
You're supposed to be my Father, bruh, I need answers
We don't need to die young, we just need chances
Tired of living on the edge so we keep scrambling
Tryna talk to these strippers but they keep dancing
We just wanna be number one like Steve Francis
Bow our heads, say a prayer, now the seed's planted
Everywhere I turn, I'm seeing MC's vanish
Lot of good niggas gone, I don't understand it
Lot of families lost and they sea stranded
I ain't tryna disrespect you, I just need answers
I know you're watching us from heaven thinking, "Who to save?"
Cherry pickin' who should go next and who should stay
I'd be on my way to heaven if I knew the way
And bring back every good nigga you choose to take
They say you never wrong, but you done made a few mistakes
'Cause you taking the wrong niggas, maybe you should trade
Trade us back all the real ones, remove the fakes
I think you should trade
Give us 2Pac back, and take that nigga Suge (Ooh!)
Let the legend resurrect and he gon' live for good (Ooh!)
I been screaming "Thug life" in every different hood (Thug life, thug life)
If only you could bring him back, Lord, I wish you would
Give us Biggie, give us Pun, give us Triple X
Take that nigga Trump with you, that's a bigger threat
There's too much power for a coward with no intellect
That's a bigot with a collar, there's a disconnect
Niggas dying, Mama crying, Grandma need a tissue
Niggas shootin' up a church, now I need a pistol
All them niggas still livin', you don't see the issue
But how you take Selena and then you take Aaliyah with you?
I ain't tryna disrespect, just need to meet up with you (Lord)
I ain't tryna overstep, just want to reason with you (Lord)
Give us back our loved ones and take the evil with you (Lord)
Send them suckers straight to hell, they don't need a vigil (Woo!)
I need you to give us back Martin Luther, take Martin Shkreli (Take!)
Give us back Malcolm, take R. Kelly
R.I.P. Lil Snupe, give that boy his life back
Take Eric Holder, give us Eric Wright back
I'm sending you this message, Lord, I hope you hit me right back
They say I'm on the wrong train, I know I'm on the right track (Yeah)
'Cause Trayvon gone, and all he did was try to fight back
Zimmerman walk around free, we don't like that (We don't like that)
Why you take our mothers from us?
Our fathers and our sisters and our cousins from us?
Got these children getting murdered while they double dutchin'
Wonder why the fuck you take Nipsey Hussle from us?
Damn, you took a true king, a true brother from us
This a fuckin' marathon, but they runnin' from us
Now everybody got guns, niggas up to something
And every gangsta wanna prove that they tough or something
You know it's not fair, tell the truth, I've been in my feelings too
But if you took Emmett Till, at least take Dylann Roof
At least take James Holmes, I ain't even mad at that
Just bring back Whitney, and give us Michael Jackson back
Feds want me in the slammer, damn
Ain't no justice for Sandra Bland, we up like the ceiling fan
Lord, if you listenin', I'm just lookin' for a hand to hand
Take out the fuck niggas and give us back our fam again
Drownin' in my tears, tryna pray for something (Woo!)
Wonder why you give us life for you to take it from us (Woo!)
Wonder why you give us family then erase them from us (Woo!)
Maybe hopefully you can have a conversation with us (Yeah)
Maybe I'm just probably tripping 'cause I need a hug (I need a hug)
The hood can't find jobs, now we need a plug (We need a plug)
Everybody and their mama tryna be a thug
I don't go to church 'cause I'm afraid of being judged
I've been starin' at the ceiling as I lie in bed
Watchin' niggas follow trends like Simon Says (Yeah)
I pray you give us back the real ones and try again
Or maybe take them niggas that deserve to die instead
Tomi Lahren run her mouth and then she get defensive
Laura Ingraham laughin' at death and disrespectin'
I really feel like you should teach them stupid hoes a lesson
Either that or give us back somebody who deserve the blessings
I left out a bunch of names that I forgot to mention
Cost too much to pay attention, then it got expensive
Father forgive me, for I know not what I do
And now I'm reachin' out to you, hopin' you hear me and return the message (Joyner)
I know that you got our back and that you're not against us
Or maybe you just love us so you doin' shit to test us
I just kinda thought that you would do more to protect us
They say that the good die young and I ain't on the guest list
I've been drinkin', Lord forgive me, it's my blood racin'
I don't know what I'm thinking, I'm just frustrated
I don't mean to question you, I'm just confused
I don't know what else to do, I've been patient and it sucks waiting
Took my mans from me, that forever hurts
But puttin' the blame on you, that'd never work
I know this ain't your fault, it's the devil's work
Devil's work80Embed

Revenge Lyrics[Intro]
The more that I want, the more that I grind
The more that I shine, the more that I stride
The more that I stunt, the more that I cheat
The more that she leaves, the more that she cry
The harder to trust, the more that I lie
The more that she die, the more I realize
The more that I, the more that I (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
The more that I try, the more that I want
More that I grind, the more that I shine
The more that I stride, the more that I stunt
The more that I cheat, the more that she leave
The more that she cry, the harder to trust
The more that I lie, the more that she dies
The more I realize I'm harder to love
I’m harder to, I'm harder to teach
My heart is a beat and I am the drum
I'm harder to keep, but harder to sleep
I’m scared of the dark, I'm not gonna run
I'm harder to break, but harder to make
You get in my way, I'm drawing my gun
I'm not gonna play, I'm not for the games
I'm not gonna change, put that on my son
Put that on my mom, put that on my sis
Put that on my bitch and all of my hoes
Put that on my team, put that on my G's
I say what I mean, you already know
Put that on my city, put that on my Bentley
I got me a Bimmer, I wanted a Rolls
Sip on some Henny and ride with the semi
All my niggas with me, I’m calling a toast (Blah, blah, blah)
Callin’ the plug, you callin' the cops
I call you a snitch, you holdin’ a grudge
You callin' the judge, you say you a thug
I call you a bitch, I call you a ho
Don't call me your bro, don't call me no more, I call you a trick
I’m tired of the hate, I'm tired of the snakes
I'm tired of your face, you all on my dick
I wanted the fame, I wanted the name
I wanted a break, I wanted the love
I wanted the cake, I wanna be great
I wanted to change and all the above
You want me to fall, you want me to crawl
You want me to stall, they want me on drugs
You want me to fail, they want me in jail
They wantin' my soul, they wantin' my blood
I'm out for revenge, I'm out for the ends
I'm out for respect, I'm out for the crown
I'm out for the reign, they startin' to aim
I hopped in a plane, I'm not going down
I'm dodging the flames, they callin' my name
I wanna be saved but I don't know how
I thought it was safe, but I got a plan
Let's load up the chopper and ride it around, woo
[Chorus]
I roll up on 'em while he sleep (Hey), you gon' see
It's a fuckin' murder spree (Brrat, bah), you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep (Bah, bah), you gon' see
Don't you turn your back on me (Brrat, bah), you gon' see
Roll up on 'em while he sleep (Doo), catch a nigga slippin'
I might hit him with the (Bah, bah-bah, bah-bah), they gon' miss him
'Cause revenge feels sweet (Woo), you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep (Bah, bah), you gon' see

[Verse 2]
Give me a pen
I don't even drink, but fuck it, I need some Henny and gin
Plenty of sins
I broke my bitch's heart, she'll never forgive me again
Where have you been?
I had to go find myself, I killed and buried my friends
I never could swim
I used to push some weight with niggas who been in the gym
Come step in my Timbs
You could not walk my path
I never caught my cabs, I had to walk
Niggas was lost and sad, I never would call my dad
Fuck that nigga
I was depressed as fuck, mentally torn in half
Feelin' stuck
When it was hard to laugh, the music was all I had
Wish I could be out
I never got any clout, what's all the plottin' about?
They drownin' me out
Everyone countin' me out, nobody try to reach out
You proud of me now?
Niggas'll flip the script, I cannot live to quit
I don't wanna chill, I don't wanna get no flicks
Don't wanna rekindle shit
It's N-O-T, don't you flex on me
I do not get no sleep
I'm barely up, hope you ante up
Word to M.O.P., you don't know me
I need my revenge, it ain't no more peace
I'm rollin' deep and I'm finna turn your block up into World War III, woah
[Chorus]
I roll up on 'em while he sleep (Hey), you gon' see
It's a fuckin' murder spree (Brrat, bah), you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep (Bah, bah), you gon' see
Don't you turn your back on me (Brrat, bah), you gon' see
Roll up on 'em while he sleep (Doo), catch a nigga slippin'
I might hit him with the (Bah, bah-bah, bah-bah), they gon' miss him
'Cause revenge feels sweet (Woo), you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep (Bah, bah), you gon' see

[Verse 3]
The older the berry, the sweeter the juice
Knew I could do it, I needed the proof
In order to lose, I needed to win
In order to win, I needed to choose
I needed to fall, I needed to move
I couldn't be safe, I couldn't be you
I'm coming for everything they said I couldn't
Including your plate and all of your food
I don't wanna do no E
Don't wanna drink, I don't wanna do no lean
I don't wanna move no keys
How you like me now? I'm too OG
I feel like Kool Moe Dee
Ain't gon' be no slatt, my whole team'll crack
I seen 'em flat, never seen no snacks, they left me the scraps
I Deebo'd that
Think I'm cursed again, went to church to sin
I did a lot
Mama quit her job, she won't work again
I been on top
Got a mental block and it hurts, but then I bid and shop
And my bitch is fly, she a perfect ten
That's M-O-B, don't you flex on me, I do not get no sleep
I'm problematic and I gotta have it, word to Ed OG
You don't know me, I need my revenge, no more peace
I'm rollin' deep and I'm finna turn your block up into World War III
[Chorus]
I roll up on 'em while he sleep (Hey), you gon' see
It's a fuckin' murder spree (Brrat, bah), you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep (Bah, bah), you gon' see
Don't you turn your back on me (Brrat, bah), you gon' see
Roll up on 'em while he sleep (Doo), catch a nigga slippin'
I might hit him with the (Bah, bah-bah, bah-bah), they gon' miss him

Won't nobody say a peep (Bah, bah), you gon' see61Embed

I Love Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love...
[Verse 1]
Look, I love it when they count me out, I'm a soldier (I'm a soldier)
Love when they think I ain't cool 'cause I'm sober ('Cause I'm sober)
You used to love when we was down, we was closer (Yeah, yeah)
But I stopped lovin' ever since I got fucked over
Ho, don't call me, I don't know ya
You gotta keep that same energy (Energy)
I'm not no regular entity (Woo)
I'm not your friend, I'm your enemy (Enemy)
I don't know what's gotten into me
Lately, I'm just feelin' finicky
Lately, I just want the cake and the greatest amenities
Lately, I ain't got no sympathy, aim at the industry
This ain't the way that they pictured me, what's your identity?
I guess I'm linin' 'em up
I keep my nine in the trunk (Bang)
All of y'all niggas gon' bleed (Bleed)
Guess it's that time of the month
I done came up from the mud
They said I'd never be nothin', they said I'd never be rich
They said I'd never be anything, I told 'em, "Get off my dick"

[Chorus]
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love...
[Verse 2]
Yo, I love days they say I couldn't eat when I fell (Yeah)
On the streets with no help (Word)
Money ain't everything (Woo)
Nigga, speak for yourself (Ayy)
Pawn shops every week (Week)
Scrapin' change, pay the bills (Yeah)
Rainy days, couldn't sleep (Word)
Now I sleep with my grills (Joyner)
I wanted to be like Hov (Woo)
I'm livin' la vida loc' (Loc')
They jus' wanna ride my wave (Woo)
You ain't never seen my boat (Splash)
Hit 'em with the Eastside smoke
I'ma kill everyone, I'm a G.I. Joe
Hidin' my weapons all in my Levi's coat
If a nigga was pimpin', you'd prolly be my ho (Woo)
I need some different opponents ('Ponents)
I think I live in the moment (Yeah)
I fuck my bitch in the mornin' (Joyner)
I take that shit when I want it (True)
All you new niggas be frontin'
You just be lyin', I keep it 300
Came up from nothin', I say what I want
And no, ain't no discussion, I aim and I bust
[Chorus]
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love

Mask Off (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Uh
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Sober minds
Dead silence
Yuh, listen, look

[Chorus]
I don't take no fucking percocets
Molly, Percocets
No ecstasy, promethazine
No lean, no purple mess
No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step
If you don't think that I'm the shit, it's just cause you ain't heard me yet
I'm 'bout to put my mask on, my mask on
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long
I know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it
[Verse]
I'm about to grab niggas by the throat
I'm about to crash Lil Yachty boat
I'm about to drag niggas by the coat
Take out your trash, sit it by the door
Shit, I got the mask on me, I'm 'bout to go
I hate when niggas act funny when I'm alone
And try to give daps to me and tip their hats to me
And they act gully when they at home
Yeah, I don't do Xannies or Mollys
Don't come near me with problems
And don't you compare me to Logic (never)
Go listen to Sriracha
Yeah, that's Amanda to Ronda
And that's a Benz to a Honda
Yeah, that's a dance with the devil
And I ain't dancing behind ya
My nigga, I'm a muthafucking entity
You don't get it, even landlords gotta pay rent to me
Gingerbread man fuckers ain't catchin' me
Sick and tired of niggas sickening, depressing me
Go to church, I testify
Pray to God I bless the beat
Kanye said "Touch the Sky"
Future might come for me
But I'm a fucking beast and if I die, that sucks for me
But where the crown I'ma kill the king
I bet a lot of haters won't feel the same
I dug the ground, I built the ring
I cut the cow I milked the game, nigga
I should cut a hole in the sky
Make you feel the rain, nigga feel the pain, nigga
A lot of rap niggas get nervous when they hear my name, nigga
I'm insane, nigga
Back when you was watching Leave It To Beaver
I was crushing on Tila Tequila
I was swagging in Adidas and Filas
Fuckin' divas call 'em Venus, Serena
Signed my deal and told em Cesar's a beater
Hope you didn't think I needed you neither
Take it back and told 'em I didn't mean it
'Cause my uncle said it's cheaper to keep it
[Refrain]
Mask off, run in the back door
Blast y'all hats off
Fuck is you mad for?
I catch y'all, smash y'all
Don't mean to laugh hard
But all you funny to me
None of you niggas half hard
You think you comin' for me but you never could last long
You don't mean nothin' to me
And I come with some shit that'll make you niggas {Imitates mumble rap flow}
Like that mumble rap shit (laugh)
Whoo, whoo!
Mask off, run in the back door
Blast y'all hats off
Fuck is you mad for?
I catch y'all, smash y'all
Don't mean to laugh hard
But all you funny to me
None of you niggas half hard
You runnin comin' for me but you never could last long
You don't mean nothin' to me
And I come with some shit
That'll make you niggas bump into me with a couple of weapons
And be afraid to get it poppin', now they duckin' and dippin', I mean
What's up with you mumble niggas that never say nothin'?
I'm about to make all of you fuckers go to bed in the oven
I go to sleep with the devil and wake up next to your mother
And you ain't telling me nothing
I mean I'm very disgustin'
I mean I'm ready to bust and
Put an end to you fucker, now what's what?
How many CDs could a woodchuck chuck
If he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?
Huh?
[Bridge]
Look, all you a lie
I don't cuff no hoes, you can have my bitch
I don't even mind
It seems like all these hoes wanna do is switch up
They rather be a guy
If she could suck my dick everyday for a living
Then that'd be her job, yuh
I said candy paint in yo fuckin' rims
.38 in yo fuckin' Benz
I was broke as fuck had a couple friends
A refrigerator and a cup of gin
Let's drink it up, me and you
'Cause these niggas fake, and I see it too
And they try to get me to pop Percocets and Molly
And I said

[Chorus]
I don't take no fucking percocets
Molly, Percocets
No ecstasy, promethazine
No lean, no purple mess
No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step
If you don't think that I'm the shit it's just cause you ain't heard me yet
I'm about to put my mask on, my mask on
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long
I know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it

Don't mean to laugh hard

You think you comin' for me but you never could last long
You don't mean nothin' to me
And I come up some shit I (inaudible)
Whoo, whoo!
Mask off, run in the back door
Blast y'all hats off
Fuck is you mad for?
I catch y'all, smash y'all
Don't mean to laugh hard

None of you niggas half hard
You think you comin' for me but you never could last long

Look Alive (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
All you a lie
Nigga, I ain't ever been a yes-man
All you gonna die, you can get murdered on webcam
I don't get tired; sweat through a headband
You might look alive, that's 'cause you don't really know you a dead man

[Verse 1]
This is God's plan, someone stop me
I've been sent here from Illuminati
Evil scriptures written on my body
Me and Satan pull up in a red Ferrari
Don't be tryin' to put your fuckin' arm around me
44 shots traumatizin' from the .45, hit 44 more
Carbon copies say you kamikazes
That's for e'rybody
Mama, Poppy
Sister, Brother, Cousin, Uncle, Auntie
This is not Versace, this is hot hibachi
This is Hiroshima, this is Nagasaki
I'm Mahatma Gandhi, a fuckin' humanoid Anunnaki
With plenty hammers when I'm ridin' shotty
Better use your manners when you talk about me
Ain't too hard to find me
I've been killin' niggas, still ain't nothin' left though
Joyner Lucas sicker than a strep throat
Spanish bitch that wanna give me besos
They must've forgot I was next up
Speed out your crib right after I clean out your shit and then put all of your fuckin' money in a escrow
Fuck what you sayin', I'm not the one that you play with
I think they really mistaken, I wasn't next up?
You thought wrong and you all gone, all done
I just might bring back Don Juan, I just might bring back Sean John
Tell P Diddy that I'm on one
I'ma beat it down with a Du-Rag
Pussy ate out, that's a PopCon
If I don't fuck with you, that's too bad (God damn)
Ho, you played out like the thong song
Ain't no bygones bein' bygones
I should murder niggas when I buy guns
Ho, you get stretched like Nylon
This is my band, I'm Dylon
All I wanna do is just drop bombs
On you cheerleadin' niggas with the pom-poms
My Jamaican bitch got socks on
Every time I hit it she be like, "wagwan"
Peter Piper picked a pepper, and I picked the pressure
Pick a fight, I pick a side, I put you on a stretcher
Peter Piper picked up a nine, I put it together
Started poppin' at the people, they 'bout to meet the Beretta
Better meet the metal, I'ma need a Fujita to measure
Put you deeper than what's deeper the sea or the desert
I've been schemin' while I'm creepin', like fifty feet to the Jetta
Niggas speed and hit the pedal, I put my feet in the metal
God damn!
[Chorus]
508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride
Nigga, this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god
I said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied
I ain't got no fuckin' job, this my life, this my, wait—

[Verse 2]
All of y'all wishy and washy
All y'all my kids in a car seat
I take my dime to hibachi, we do 69 like Tekashi
Lyin' in the sand, too much time in your hands
I think I need to find you a hobby
God got a plan, hope that God hold your hand
I think I'm 'bout to catch me a body!
Tell all my teachers that I said I'm back on my G shit
And I'm comin' back to get even
I went on tour and got paid, now I'm back in the region
I let off this mac for no reason
You are now witnessin' greatness
I'm practically preachin' and this is the passion of Jesus
And all you basic motherfuckas are lackin' achievement
And I've just been laughin' and geekin'
Back to business, I got mad intentions
I ain't perfect, I done made some bad decisions
But it's competition, I'm a savage winnin'
You can have the digits, I'm a mathematician
I don't see you niggas, I've been lackin' vision
You've been actin' different, I've been actin' distant
I'ma do some shit to bring me mad attention
You gon' do some shit that send me back to prison, whoa!
This is uncomfortable, you just keep puttin' your feet in a fire
I think my gun got a crush on you, boy
You 'bout to meet your secret admirer
How you do shit you don't wanna do?
I do that shit just to keep me inspired
I used to hit it and leave when I wanted to
Now I hit it and be sleepin' aside her, woo
Roll up on 'em when I pull up on 'em
Put that motherfuckin' smoke up on 'em with that holy water
Joyner Lucas, I'm a holy mona leader motor runnin'
Man, too many niggas know about it, but I thought about it
Prayed about it to the Lord about it in the mornin', but I gotta show 'em what it's all about and I'ma call 'em out
I ain't that nigga you could talk about, you better calm it down
Don't be tryna give me the runaround, I'ma shut 'em down god damn, wait
[Chorus]
508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride
Nigga this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god
I said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied
I ain't got no fuckin' job, this my life, this my

[Verse 3]
This is God's plan, someone stop me
I was sent here from Illuminati
Evil scriptures written on my body
Me and Satan pull up in a red Buggati
Don't be tryna put your fuckin' arm around me
Bring the drama, it ain't hard to find me
This a lucid dream, this a out-of-body
UFO flyin' while I'm ridin' shotty
I'm a ninja, pull up on a Kawasaki
187 on the cops behind me
This is Hiroshima, this is Nagasaki
I'm Mahatma Gandhi in a Maserati, god damn
Now call me Papi
Plenty hammers when I'm ridin' shotty
Better use your manners when you talk about me
It ain't hard to find me, motherfucker
My name Joyner38Embed

Will Lyrics[Intro]
Hey
Will
Yeah

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' like Will (Hey), I think I'm a prince, I'm feelin' myself (Buck, buck)
I'm loaded with bills 'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil (Woah)
Don't know how it feels, I wanted to flex, they told me to chill (Chill)
I'm makin' a flip (Flip), my life is a flick, come load up the film (Hey)

[Verse 1]
I got me some paper, hired a butler and got me a waiter (Woah)
I wanna get married, but none of my shorties remind me of Jada
Or maybe I'm just too afraid to settle, I wish I was plannin' it different
I think It's a phase, I'm very conditioned
I'm stuck in my ways and scared of commitment, I'm very conflicted (Ooh)
I got the drip and I'm saucy, ooh (Buck, buck, buck)
ADHD, I'm a bad boy
I think I might just pull up in the 'Rari, ooh
I might just skrrt up the Philly
They call me Big Willie, I think I'm Mike Lowrey, ooh
Ain't nothin' much you can tell me, I blew through a milli and threw me a party, ooh (Buck, buck)
[Refrain]
I know I'm the one
Dammit, I made it, I look at my son
I feel like I'm dreamin', he truly a blessin'
I'm really elated, I pray that he grow up like Willow or Jaden
I know that he will
I hope he look up to me like we used to look up to Phil
I know that's it's real
I lay a brick at a time for somethin' I know I can build
I learn it from Will

[Verse 2]
I know ain't nothin' gon' set us back (Buck)
You take it from me, I get it back (Buck, buck)
Me and my homies forever strapped (Buck)
We roll up on 'em like Men in Black (Bah)
I blow your chest through your head and back (Yeah)
I think I done made a mess (Mess)
I'm in Cali with a vest (Hey)
That's the wild wild West (Yeah)
I told my homies I'm good with the labels
I don't need to sign the dots (Yeah)
They must not know me
They cannot control me 'cause I ain't no I, Robot (Hey)
Yeah, I grew up on a legend and I gotta show it
I learned a lot from him and I owe it
Homie's my idol and don't even know it, ooh
[Chorus]
I'm feelin' like Will (Hey), I feel like a prince, I'm feelin' myself (Buck, buck)
I'm loaded with bills (Ooh) 'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil (Blah)
Don't know how it feels (Feels), I wanted to flex, they told me to chill (Chill)
I'm makin' a flip (Flip), my life is a flick, now load up the film

[Verse 3]
I'm goin' back to Miami to meet with the cartel (Ooh-ooh)
All of you rappers be runnin' 'round tellin' shark tales (Hey-hey)
I was tryna make a flip when y'all was doin' cartwheels
The Pursuit of Happyness
I was rock bottom now I'm out spendin' large bills (Oh)
And I got a shorty who stuck in a bubble
But I'm still in love with her hustle (Ooh)
Her body bangin' but she don't stop talkin'
I wish that she come with a muzzle (Ooh)
I don't know if I'm in love with the pieces
Or I'm just in love with the puzzle (Hey)
But I had to leave her 'cause I know
These girls these days ain't nothin' but trouble (Nothin' but trouble)

[Refrain]
I know I'm the one
Damn it, I made it, now look what I’ve done (Buck, buck, buck)
I feel like I’m dreamin', I count all my blessings
I’m really elated, I know I Am Legend or one in the makin'
I know that it’s real
I hope they look up to me like we used to look up to Phil (Buck, buck, buck)
I know that you will
I lay a brick at a time for somethin' I know I can build (Buck, buck, buck)
[Verse 4]
That's how we leave an impression (Buck)
Yes, I believe in expression (Hey)
I got some secrets and weapons (Buck)
That might just leave a concussion (Ah)
Give me three wishes, I think I'm Aladdin
But there ain't no genie to bless us (Yeah)
I ain't had nothin' just me and heater at night
He be sleep on the dresser (Word)
I cannot fold, I hit all my goals, I did it with pride (Did it with pride)
Ain't nothin' worst than losin' your hero and couldn't say bye (Couldn't say bye)
And we never know just when it's our time
The legends are gone and we don't know why
So before they go, look here go a toast
So give 'em a rose while they still alive (Buck)

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' like Will (Hey), I feel like a prince, I'm feelin' myself (Buck, buck)
I'm loaded with bills (Ooh) 'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil (Blah)
Don't know how it feels (Feels), I wanted to flex, they told me to chill (Chill)

Litty (Freestyle) Lyrics[Verse 1]
What's up with you R&B niggas tryna turn rappers and trappers (Joyner, Joyner)
You should just stay in your lane, bro, you sound like PaRappa the Rapper (Yeah, yeah)
I'm looking down on you when you talk to me, you should grab you a ladder
You swung at me, only jabbed at my bladder
Watch you disappear like you abracadabra (Poosh)
Now grab me a dagger
You got some hits but you lacking a swagger (Yeah)
I'm still the shit, bitch, so that doesn't matter
Don't call me a kid, I'm your papi and dada (Hahaha)
You get splattered and flattened
You an' Trippie better have you some backup (Hol' up)
Ren and Stimpy looking agi' and staggered
And when I kill 'em, they get madder and madder
Time to get litty, bitch, fuck all that singin' (Yeah)
You challenge me, what the fuck is you thinking? (Woo)
Way too much weed, what the fuck is you drinkin'?
I brought the tsunami, you fuckers are sinkin' (Brrrat)
I'm glad that you came
Leave all that lyrical shit up to me, I'm a savage that bang
Bring all your Prada suits back to Lee Chang (Brrrat)
Take all that autotune back to T-Pain
I swear you R&B rappers is strange
You okay but you ain't nobody favorite (Yeah)
You a'ight but you ain't nobody major
5'3", you ain't nobody dangerous (Brat)
Maybe that weed you were smoking, had you feeling confident
Let's have a real conversation (Boom)
Maybe that doctor put something inside of your head
When you got your new hairline replacement (Brrrat)
[Chorus]
Why you bring my name up in the first place, Tory? (Huh)
You ain't fucking with me on my worst day, Tory
Wasn't better than me when I was in first grade, Tory
We can do this every year or on your birthday, Tory (Dook, dook, dook, dook)
Every summer, every winter, every Earth day, Tory (Joyner)
Every Tuesday, every Thursday, Tory
It's gon' be a motherfuckin' anniversary, Tory
You done fucked up, now you need first aid, Tory (Dook, dook, dook, dook)

[Verse 2]
I'm the leader of the new school with a screw loose (Woo)
All you niggas Blues Clues with a fruit juice (Woo)
Turn your Jimmy Choo shoes into FUBU
Nigga, you do what you can, I do what I choose to
I get litty in this bitch for my city (Yuh)
Only few real niggas left, they ain't many (Yuh)
They compare me to Em, they compare you to Iggy (Oh)
They compare me to Meth, they compare you to Glizzy (Oh, oh)
I'm Leonardo Da Vinci, I paint a picture with color
I already got cake and I don't need a butler (Yeah)
We already got Drake and we don't need another
I don't really got space but I'ma eat your supper (Woo)
You know Joyner got a hotter flow
I'ma do what Travis should've did a while ago (Woo)
I'ma do what Drake should've did a while ago
Throw your ass off a cliff, make you say, "Geronimo"
Then you had one chance, now you slumped on (Duh)
Go back in the booth, make another love song (Duh)
What you gon' do when the fucking blunt's gone?
'Cause I wanted all the smoke, I ain't even puff long (No)
Nigga, I been packing a black MAC with it wrapped in a backpack
With a stack and I'm Mad Max in the back of the black cab
With a gat and a snapback, put a cap in yo' back fat
Murder you and your wack little Cat in the Hat raps
Finna stab if you jab back, and I clap at you mad fast
When you sing, you ain't half bad, but you rapping like Ras Kass
And I bet that you mad sad 'cause you 'bout to get laughed at
And buried in trash bags and left in a hatchback, my nigga
Jamming in front of the corner store, whoa
Mobbin' a lot in the corridor, whoa
Breakin' some shit you don't want no more
Fightin' when nobody want a war
Rob at the haters, gon' sing like the Commodores
I got some shit you ain't saw before
Swallow the key and I lock the door
Tory, you ain't gotta hide no more
Come out and play, you my prey, you the GOAT? I'm a dinosaur
Oh, you wan' hate, that's normal
You just gonna do what you supposed to ('Posed to)
I remember when them hoes called me old news
Now when they cheat, I'm the go-to (Joyner)
Word on the street's I ain't one to get close to
I was hopeless, now I'm hopeful (Yuh)
I done made my own way like I'm supposed to
All you niggas did what you was told to (Yeah)
Tory, why all your songs always sound like a rerun, nigga? (Huh)
I just want my motherfucking refund, nigga (Huh)
Funny looking ass, go and eat some', nigga
I ain't never had to get my fucking teeth done, nigga (Hahaha)
When I kill you, I ain't running to you, bleed some, nigga (Yuh)
Oh, you wan' be some nigga? (Yuh)
Me and 6ix9ine had Trippie Redd bitch on the couch
She was giving us a threesome, nigga
[Chorus]
Why you bring my name up in the first place, Tory? (Yeah)
You ain't fucking with me on my worst day, Tory (Uh)
Wasn't better than me when I was in first grade, Tory
We can do this every year on your birthday, Tory (Brrrat)
Every summer, every winter, every Earth day, Tory
Every Tuesday, every Thursday, Tory
It's gon' be a motherfucking anniversary, Tory
You done fucked up, now you need first aid, Tory

Panda (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Joyner, woo, woo
Ayo I'm tired of this fucking beat
Ayo, how many of y'all niggas
How many of y'all niggas gotta do this beat?
I'm gonna kill this fucking panda, man
I'm done

[Chorus]
I'm tired of this fucking panda song, I don't stand alone, I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw, burn 'em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke 'em, beat 'em, put a couple hammers on 'em, dab on a nigga while I'm standing on 'em

[Post-Chorus]
Kick him, punch him, throw him, make him slam the wall, tie him to a cannon, make him a cannon ball
Into the ocean, make him suffer too, nigga, this is fucking animal abuse
Animal cruelty on the fucking news, I'ma kill the panda 'til he bloody, too
[Verse 1]
I'll make him black and blue, fuck the black and white, I don't fuck with niggas like a pack of dykes
Eat the panda bitch, I got an appetite, I'm out this world, I swear that I'm a satellite
How many rappers gotta try to pay me? Tired of hearing niggas on the same beat
Time to kill the panda in my old pajamas, flying to Atlanta in the same week
What's a panda to a fucking polar bear? A gorilla to a monkey, tiger to a puppy
Lion to a kitten, wolf to a pigeon, shark to a fish and snake to an infant?
Alligator in the water wet, Joyner Lucas to a dinosaur and pet
They ain't know that I'm Tyrannosaurus Rex, cut the panda up and rip apart his neck
I ain't doing interviews and autographs, I don't like the way you talking all of that
I should fuck your bitch and never call her back, I'd go down in history as an artifact but...

[Chorus]
I'm tired of this fucking panda song, I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw, burn 'em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke 'em, beat 'em, put a couple hammers on 'em, dab on a nigga while I'm standing on 'em

[Post-Chorus]
Kick him, hit him, make him slam the wall, tie him to a cannon, make a cannon ball
Into the ocean, make him suffer too, nigga, this is fucking animal abuse
Animal cruelty on the fucking news, I'ma kill the panda 'til he bloody, too

[Verse 2]
That's a bloody mess, that's a bloody death, tell them niggas hating on me, "suck a dick"
I ain't satisfied until I get to smash J-Lo and give her ass a couple kids
I’ve been on Animal Planet, I got my hands on the phantom, I kill it again, and nobody gotta hand me a Grammy
Goddamnit, I bet they don’t even want to hear what they planning, I see another Panda again and then I blam with the hammer
The man with a plan, you looking at the man in the mirror, the man with a killer that drill a nigga straight in the building
I hang with realest, I really wanna handle my business, I get it, I get in, I gotta get it, damn it, I did it
I’m out of this commodity, ‘bouta be outta there, hotter than riding inside of a driver seat at Leh and Ladakh
How did we get out of them out of a prodigy, nigga? All I ever wanted was to hit the lottery, nigga
All eyes on me and they gotta be, nigga, swear to God, 2Pac could be proud of me nigga
All I know is the fire burning inside of me, nigga, all I ever could be is real as I gotta be, nigga
But why you all wanna act hard?, where I'm from, we get it popping in the backyard
Now everybody wanna run up on the back door, half pussy, half bitch, you a cat-dog
Let me see you do the cat daddy on a black Caddy, shorty got a fat fattie and flat belly
All she do is lap giving if she act petty, I'll kill a panda, throw that nigga off a balcony for running his mouth to me
And y'all done got me mad, I'ma put the panda in a body bag
What you doing 'round here? Why you standing 'round? Why you niggas tryna lollygag?
You ain't got a life and you proud of that? All you wanna know is where the Molly at
All you hoes think about is Prada bags, I done killed the panda, where Desiigner at? Nigga
But this is not a diss, don't call it that, I'm just giving all you pandas hepatitis
Cancer, HIV and a heart attack, all you broke bitches need to call a cab
'Cause I ain't- ha-ha-ha
Yo, stop rapping over this goddamn beat 'cause I ain't too fond of that, look
[Chorus]
I'm tired of this fucking panda song, I don't stand alone, I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw, burn 'em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke 'em, beat 'em, put a couple hammers on 'em, dab on a nigga while I'm standing on 'em

Ross Capicchioni Lyrics[Verse 1]
Woke up at 7, my day seemed more than I prayed for
Got dressed up to head out and ride to school on my skateboard
New kid in class I sat alone takin' notes while the hoodlums were makin' jokes at the clothes that my momma paid for
Seemed like everyone was a part of some gang invasion
Tattoos, the initiation, parolers I’m on probation
Soakin' up the vibe as I study for information
'Cause lately I been deprived of a normal day
But today, on my way to eat lunch, some kid approached me
He told me “we should be cool” if only he got to know me
'Cause on this side of town I would need some protection
It’s crazy, reckless and dangerous
Unless I’m some sort of gangster, I’m only safe with the police
He said his name was [blank]
I dapped him up at the busses
I was kinda skept' about him at first cause I didn’t trust him
The more I got to know him, I couldn’t tell what his motives were
Hopin' that he was sincere, somethin' told me “let go”
But the only thing on my mind was patience
Searchin' twice for a different life, I was tired of waitin'
'Cause me and [blank] had similar views and conversations infused with knowledge
Mainly 'bout school and college, that was my truth, but regardless
He was type cool when I was wit' him
Introduce him to my family, they were rockin' wit' him
My momma told him, “Make sure you look out for my son”
And before she could finish her sentence, he quickly just interjected and said, “Don’t you even stress it, I got it under control.”
It’s been two months since we met, it seemed like we’d gotten close
Some cat approached me and tried to beef wit' me, I just froze
Then I see [Blank] pounded and stompin' homie right out his clothes
Called me his brother and told me he got me to the fullest
Even if that mean bullets, bullies, gangs, AKs and choppas ‘till they kill us
That’s the realest shit I ever witnessed
A few weeks later, my uncle sold me a Honda Civic
A ’93 with no license plates and no registration
Just thinkin' about every place that I’ma go when I finally get it
And then he asked me for a ride around the block some distance from where I was parkin
And instantly I knew the spot was sketchy, my momma would kill me
My intuition told me not to, I knew it was wild
And plus I knew I had no business or place on that side of town
And I read about some chick that went lurkin' without a sound and got murked
Her body found in that dirt, with a thousand rounds
It was worse than abandoned buildins of bandits, villians, and scammers
Killers provokin' gangsters, but maybe I’m overthinkin'
Maybe I might be straight just as long as I pump the brakes
And try not to think about it just trust I’ll be fuckin' safe
And then I told him, “Let’s go, hop in.”
He dapped me up, he started tellin' jokes the whole ride there
Had me crackin' up
As we were gettin closer, I felt funny, my stomach turned
Then he told me, “Go left, make another turn, go right, and drive slow”
As I look, it was all abandoned and quiet, not a single person in sight, nobody standin
And right when I pulled the car to the side
He said, “Right here, sit still. Turn the car off and chill.”
That’s when I start to panic he told me, “Relax.”
Then he pulled the keys out the ignition and hopped out and laughed
Then my life flashed in an instant
He inched to my driver door then I tried to lock it, I couldn’t
Ripped me right outta my seat and then grabbed the side of his jeans and then
Pulled out the shotty and all I heard was a screech and he shot my arm into pieces
I’m thinkin' I must be dreamin’, another shot to my chest
And my stomach’s squeezin', my breath or my lungs collapsin
I’m down on my fuckin knees askin' him, “Why?”
He looked at me, I looked him dead in the eyes
And he smashed my face with the barrel
And I throw my teeth to the sky and then uh
I heard a [cocks shotgun] sound of the shotty cock back
He pressed it hard against my head and blew my fuckin top back
I’m still conscious, I’m breathin'
I’m still movin', no clue as to why I’m not dead
All this blood that I’m losin' and I heard my car drive off
And I looked up and saw the sun and that was all that I saw
Then I heard my conscience tell me, “Get up nigga get up! You’re losin' blood, oh my! Don’t fall asleep or you’ll die! Stay awake and move as much as possible, there’s no time! Find some help or try to yell, you ain’t too well, oh God! Wake up, nigga! Wake up! Wake up, nigga! Wake up…”
[Verse 2]
Woke up at 7, my day was worse than I prayed for
Got dressed, then head out, down the stairs from the eighth floor
New kid in class, he sat alone, takin' notes while my niggas were makin' jokes
At the clothes that his mama paid for
Had no family, but was cool with the local gangstas
Tattoos, and now I’m on parole and probation for breakin' rules
That life was all I knew, all I wanted was to do was cruise
Smoke weed and say, “Fuck school”
Wanted guidance cause all my role models I would look up to
Was indicted a young dude with no logic
I went to church 'till the pastor said, “Fuck you.”
Now I’m violent and this gang that always looked out for me
Vouched for me and adopted me said they wanted to rock wit me
And I wanted to get down, guess there was somethin' missin'
Everything comes with a price, “There’s only one condition:
All you gotta do for initiation is kill an innocent victim and leave em there with no witnesses or no snitches
If you do that, you’d be down with the clique and that’s for life so don’t you ever think you getting outta this shit"
I thought about it
Soakin' up the vibe as I study for information, tryna choose my victim, plottin' the weakest prey
But today on my way to eat lunch, I approached him
And told him we should be cool, if only I got to know him
Cause on this side of town, he would need some protection
It’s crazy reckless or If only, unless he some sort of gangster and he only safe with the police
He said his name was [blank] and I dapped him up at the busses
Was kind of skeptic about me at first cause he didn’t trust me
Then the more he got to know me, he couldn’t tell what my motives were
Hopin’ that I was sincere, but little did he know I was tryna snake him and pop a brick
Just need the perfect opportunity, I’m tired of waitin’
A murder runnin’ through my head, I knew that death was comin’
He introduced me to his family, I was jealous of him
His momma told me “Make sure you look out for my son-“
And before she could finish her sentence I quickly just interjected and said
“Don’t you even stress it. I got him to the fullest, even if that means bullets, bullies, gangs, AKs and choppas till they kill us.”
I was lyin to the fuckin’ limits
Took advantage when he said he had that Honda Civic
A ’93 with no license plates and no registration
Just thinkin’ about every place I’ma go when I finally kill him
And then I asked him for a ride around the block, some distance from where he was parked
And instantly I knew my chance was comin’, I’m ready to drill him
Then he told me, “Let’s go, hop in.”
I dapped him up and started tellin jokes the whole ride there
Had him crackin up
As we were gettin’ closer, he felt funny
I think he knew somethin’ was comin’, that look he had was enough to tell me
But fuck it, go right and drive slow
As he looked, it was all abandoned and quiet
Not a single person in sight and nobody standin
And right when he pulled the car to the side
I said, “Right here, sit still. Turn the car off and chill.”
Then he start to panic, I told him, “Relax.”
Then I pulled the keys out the ignition and hopped out, laughed
His life flash in an instant
I inched to his driver door then he tried to lock it, he couldn’t
And I ripped him right out his seat then I grabbed the side of my jeans and then
I pull out the shotty, I cocked it twice ‘till he screamed
And I shot his arm into pieces, I’m watchin’ his blood leakin’
And another shot to his chest, seen his stomach squeezing
His breath and his lungs collapse and he down to his fuckin’ knees
Askin’ me, “Why?”
He looked at me, I looked him dead in the eyes
Then I smashed his face with the barrel, and I throw his teeth to the sky
And then [cocks shotgun] sound of the shotty cock back
I pressed it hard against his head and blew his fuckin’ top back24Embed

Winter Blues Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Damn I feel so loose, I'm about to pop shit
What's a man to do when he's out of options
I ain't wanna do it but it
(Shh, hold on, be quiet, they're coming..)

[Chorus]
Oh no no no no no no (Blap, blap, blap)
Oh no no no no no no (Shoop, shoop, shoop)
Oh no no no no no no (Skrt, skrt, skrt)
No no no no no no
I said gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, you heard what I said
Nigga run that, run that, run that, run that, you heard what I said
I said yeah, oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no no
[Verse 1]
I remember everything was different
When I tried to get a job and make some money, I was livin' on the street
I walked a lot of miles and nobody wasn't hiring
And I had to stand in line if I was to get something to eat
'Cause I ain't had no homies and my girl depended on me
Every night that we were lonely and I couldn't get no sleep
'Cause I was plotting on anybody I seen that was getting money
You got it? I need it sorry, you don't need it more than me
And bitch, I'm tired of this struggle, ducking and dodging them puddles
Wondering if God ever hear the prayers I said
'Cause every time I got a new hustle, that shit done got me in trouble
You don't know how many fucking tears I've shed
But fuck it, I'm letting loose, and they told me don't bend the rules
This is my winter blues, you know what I'm finna do
Anything necessary to make it up in the news
And I'm taking every mothafucking thing that I pick and choose
And I'm done with all the begging, I'm past that, all I did was get laughed at
You can go back track but you'll never get cash back
And they told me I'm half black, but I'm white as a lab rat
With a mic and a gas mask, I'm a light for your trash ass
And I might get the last laugh, better fight if you back stab
With a knife in your backpack, all my life I've been jabbed at
But I fight like I'm Mad Max with a knife with the yeah, yeah
You know, you know what the fuck I'm talking about
Listen, I don't give a fuck about your feelings
You don't have any idea just what I had to do to get what I want
All I wanted was to make a decent living
I can't even count it on my fingers how much shit that I lost
Woo, nigga, this is my job
Yeah, these are my thoughts
Woo, I ain't never had shit
But for now you better give me what's yours
[Pre-Chorus]
Damn I feel so loose, I'm about to pop shit
What's a man to do when he's out of options
I ain't wanna do it but this
(Shhh, hold on, be quiet, they're coming)

[Chorus]
Oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no
No no no no no no
I said gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, you heard what I said
Nigga run that, run that, run that, run that, you heard what I said
I said yeah, oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no no

[Verse 2]
You really got some nerve talkin' bout me like you're better
Cause you got your shit together and I'm really goin' through it
I don't think you have a clue what it feels like
Doin' dirt knowin' in your heart you ain't wanna do it
I don't got one G bone in my body
I ain't never gang banged, I don't know nothing about it
I don't claim to be a thug nigga or Illuminati
But there really ain't no tellin' what I do when I get rowdy
And I'm starvin' and my back against the wall and you ballin'
Everytime I see you, all you do is flash hundreds
Everything on fleek, I ain't never had nothin'
I just wanna be you, wanna feel like stuntin'
And lettin' loose and they told me don't bend the rules
This is my winter blues, you don't know what I finna do
Anything necessary to make it up in the news
And I'm taking every mothafuckin' thing that I pick and choose
I'm done with that hating shit, the fuck do you think this is?
Damn it, you made me sick, ain't no time for no babysit
This is the way we live and yes I'm okay with this
You think you all that and a bag of potato chips?
Could jump off a crazy bridge, and enough of you idiot kids
Go suckin' a lady dick, I would never just make amends
With none of you shakin' hands in public like yeah yeah
Like get the fuck out of my face, dude
Listen, I don't give a fuck about your feelings
You don't have any idea just what a nigga had to do to get loose
All I wanted was to make a decent living
I can't even count on all my fingers how much shit I went through
Woo, what I went through
Yeah, what I went through
Uh, and when shit get real
Ain't really nothing that you can do, woo
[Voicemail]
Yo, what's up, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you
Peace
[Brief Message]
Yo, who the fuck do you think you are
Tryna give advice to a child? My child
Nigga, you the biggest piece of shit I've ever met in my life, my nigga
You the last person that should be trying to give advice
To anybody about anything, let alone my fucking kid
Acting like some fucking role model or some shit
Nigga, no nobody wanna be like you, stop it15Embed

Ultrasound Lyrics[Voicemail]
Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace

[Brief Message]
You know, you really piss me off sometimes
I spent all night waiting for you to come home
And I've woken up without you
I don't know where you are or why you're not answering your phone
But I'm starting to get worried
I really hope you're not pissing away the last of our money
At the stupid casino again
Because you know my next check won't be here 'til the third
And we literally have nothing right now
If you did go to the casino and you have more money, then I guess
[Verse]
Get the, fuck, off, of my, dick, ho, fuck you mean? (Woo)
I don't think you notice what you done to me (Yeah)
Yeah I think you should know that you are under me
If anybody got a problem, tell 'em they can come to me
What the fuck you mean? This is not allowed (Ayy)
Better calm it down (Woo)
Cause all you new niggas just watered down
I can see through you like a muh'fuckin' ultrasound, woo!
Okay, be ready to hold up then, I'm ready to roll up on them
I'm ready to mow them, make your motor spin
I'll blow the boat up then be gone and wonderin' what you noticin'
A couple of hoes that I've been boning since a nigga was only ten
I'm tryna to get all up in that pussy harder than my youngin' (Woo)
You fallin' and you love it (Yeah)
Can't stand the heat but you all up in the oven (Sha)
I remember when I used to ball on a budget
(Hol' up) Now wait a minute (Woah)
You finally got some paper, couldn't wait to get it (Yeah)
And it don't really matter 'cause you're still lame
No matter how much cake you got, it wouldn't make a difference (Don't matter)
I'm tired of all you rappers wantin' free verses
The fuck up outta here, this how I make a livin' (This how I make a livin')
I dive up in that pussy like Jamaican niggas (Bumbaclot)
I spend all of my dollars on some Laker tickets (Yeah)
I think if I die young, they gon' miss me too
I think I'ma buy guns, maybe empty two (Bla, bla, bla)
I think I'ma sell drugs to the kids at school
I think I'ma get buzzed if it gets me through
I think I'ma need to hide if they know where I live (Yeah)
I think I'ma drink and drive til' I total the whip (Woah)
I think I'ma get high, give her all of the dick
Even if she ain't mine so she knows what it is, wait (She know what it is)
(She know what it is) Hold up though, I'm ready to roll up on them
I'm ready to mow them, make your motor boat
I blow the boat up then be gone, I'm wonderin' what you notice though
A couple of hoes that I've been bonin' since a nigga was on it though
My nigga, what's your worst fear? I been running from the start
Scared to be a man, tryna hustle in the dark
Running down the stairs, gotta hustle every March
Eating supper, getting filled, watching "Rumble in the Bronx"
I slip inside into the puddle of your heart
Nigga I don't trust you plus you never play the part
I been living in the ghetto where the devils pray to God, nigga
(Hol up, hol up) I said
I been living in the ghetto where the devils pray to God, hold up
(Hol up, hol up) Mm
I been living in the (wait wait)
Yeah, look
Get the, fuck, off, of my, dick, bi-, wait a minute (wait a minute)
I'ma fuck your bitch to let my neighbor hit it (neighbor hit it)
She told me, "Maybe we could go on a date"
I told her, "No way, but we could say we did it"
Heh, I'm such a lost soul
Even my mom knows, that's why she hate a nigga (hate a nigga)
Yeah, I'm such an asshole
Even Superman couldn't save a nigga (Joyner)
Get the, fuck, off—of my cock
[Voicemail]
Yo wassup, this is Joyner

Lotto Lyrics[Intro]
Mally Mall

[Verse 1]
It's my birthday, I'm 'bout to get lit-lit (Lit-lit)

Make it all back on a quick flip, ayy (Ayy)

Switch lanes on 'em, hit the mid range (Mid range)
Keep the big strap on me like a hitman (Brra)

I ain't never been shit, ain't shit changed (Shit changed)
But niggas get lame when you get fame (Brra)
Can't sleep at night 'til I get brains
Got a mean ass pipe and a dick game
[Bridge]
I got a bitch on my sofa (Sofa)
I got a chip on my shoulder (Shoulder)
You gotta live with your karma
And if you get hurt then you got what you supposed to (Boom)

I take the kids on drugs and line 'em all up and get 'em all sober (Woo)

I got a little check that I cashed out, ayy (Ayy)
Credit card maxed out, ayy (Ayy)
I get lit then I act out, ayy (Ayy)
I ain't wanna do it but I blacked out, ayy (Woo)
They say I need to be safe (Safe)
I think I need to be straight
Fix your vibes, you need to be laced
You just need God or you need to meet Mase
I left my bitch, maybe we just need space (Space)
I got gunners like Chris, like Niecey (Like me)
I got brothers like Tip, like Breezy (Like Breezy)
I got stunners like Wayne, like BG (Okay)

Still can't pull your pants up
Kidnap kids like Amber (Ayy)
Hold a lil' nigga for a ransom (Ooh)
I moved from the trap to the mansion (Mansion)
Went from the Uber to a Phantom (Word)
You niggas gassed up, don't amp 'em
I've never been pretty, but my mom think I'm handsome (Yeah)

If I Told You Lyrics[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Uh
What if I told you that I was different?
What if I told you that something's missin'?
And what if I told you we're not alike
And the way that I feel inside is different than what you picture
What if I told you I feel divided?
Keep to myself and I'm awfully quiet
And what if I told you I been conflicted by my own thoughts
Trapped in the dark, and I tried to hide it
No, I'm not a slave to no fuckin' fairy tale
I bet you think that you know me very well
Make no mistake, this is not a cry for help
'Cause I don't owe no one no explanation on how I feel

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
But on the real, what if I told you that I was brave?
I grew up different than I was raised
But still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait
What if I told you that I was gay?
[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah
What if I told you I'm not alright?
I mean, I don't feel dead, but I'm not alive
And what if I told you, "I'm not like you"
And the shit I've been goin' through, it'll prolly make you cry
And what if I told you, "I'm not this"
And the person you think you know don't exist
Look, I'm not who you know, I'm not who you wish
I'm not who you want me to be, what you want from me isn't this
I grew up in church where I couldn't be myself
I felt like a prisoner, couldn't leave my cell
They told me, "God don't like ugly," and this an ugly world
And if I ever seen things different, then I would burn in hell

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
And on the real, this is not new, this is not a phase
I grew up different than I was raised
But still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait
What if I told you that I was gay?
[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
What if I told you I'm homophobic?
And you have zero control over your impulses
And the genetic flaw in your chromosomes is the culprit
It's something I can't sugarcoat, it's repulsive
We were homies, since children, I thought it
But thought I was buggin', though
'Cause we'd sit, chill and just talk chicks
Now how can we be friends still after all this
Unless, I can convince you to repent
Ask God to forgive you for your sins
And begin healin' your conscience
And rid you of this sick illness that causes it
Part of me wishes you'd kept this shit, still in the closet
I'm white but I'm gettin' mixed feelings like Logic
Yeah, I'm pissed off a little, this is a choice
We were supposed to be boys
You're actin' like this ain't optional
What if I said you was weak?
'Cause you don't got the strength to conquer some biological monster that's part of you
That's responsible for them homosexual thoughts
If you don't want a lecture, part
Like a sofa section or long as you
Make your decision and stand by it, but I can't be beside it
'Cause for me, that'd be next to impossible
Or you learn to control your urges
You say, "It's like pullin' teeth and morals are oral surgeons"
But how would you even know anyways if you're a virgin
Why can't you be a normal person?
What if I tried steerin' you towards a girlfriend?
Wouldn't work, would it? You seem pretty surefooted
I'm sure good at judgin', but I have no right
I know goodbye seems cold, right?
Not even a flicker of hope like a strobe light
As I leave and I swear I stayed up that whole night
And no, I didn't know you would go right home and go take your own life
I ain't mean for that shit to happen, I said I won't cry
I let the best friend that I've ever known die
Alone, was gonna tell you the next day
I'm so sorry, I'm fightin' my own demons, I won't lie
They won't leave me alone, eating at my soul, this whole time
I've been tortured, imprisoned in my own mind
A born again Christian but Lord if you're listenin'
We might be headed for a collision
'Cause when I told my boy I couldn't support his decision
I was tryna make it seem like a choice, when it isn't
Can't be cured with a prayer to Saint Jude
What If I told you my wish never came true?
What if I'm a hypocrite who's afraid to just face truth? Wait
What if I told you I'm gay too?
[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh

I Lied (Intro) Lyrics[Intro]
Go
Buck, buck, buck

[Verse 1]
I think I was born inside a cabana
With diamonds and gold on top of the Phantom
Jesus told Mary, "Go get me a hammer
I'll kill any nigga that try to get near him"
All of the angels were drinkin' tequila
And Michael was sleepin' with Dirty Diana
And now I can't look at the man in the mirror
My life is a movie and here is the trailer
I ain't no killer, but don't try to play me
I'm out of my pills and now I'm just crazy
I jumped out of Heaven 'cause Lucifer paid me
I needed the money to buy a Mercedes
I fucked a few bitches, I had me a baby
I hope that my son don't grow up to hate me
I'm out of my mind and no one can save me
I wish I—(Urgh)
[Chorus]
Back when a nigga was jobless, tryna get by
Plottin' on shootin' myself (Brruck, buck, buck)
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry
Think I was losin' myself (Brruck, buck, buck, buck)
I prayed to God, and promised if he made me rich
Then I'ma stay true to myself (Buck, buck, buck)
But fuck it, I lied, and now I just stare in the mirror
Like what did I do to myself? (Brruck, buck, buck, buck)
I think the old me died
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
All the damn promises, I forgot
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied

[Verse 2]
I told my girl I'll give her the world
Whatever she want, consider it done
Soon as I'm rich, I'll buy you a crib
And get you a whip, whatever you want
Promise my niggas, "I'll give you a million
A couple of cars just so you can stunt"
Then I got famous, blew up my head
And fuck what I said, my nigga, I'm gone
Hop out the foreign and jump in the stretch
Life is a bitch, I fucked her to death
And how do I feel? I'm somewhat depressed
I'll probably get killed, but fuck it, I'm blessed
Nigga, I'm rich, I'm done with the stress
Now I got drip, and blood niggas sweat
They love when I trip, they want me in debt
Go choke on a dick and cut me a check
All of these meds done got me a fever
I wanted a chain but got me a Visa
I came in the game, just proppin' my feet up
You niggas is strange, you follow the leader
And me and my pistol like Martin and Gina
We plot on you niggas, I'm probably a schemer
I'm easy to hate, I'm harder to love
You say you don't trust me, I wouldn't either, woah
(I wouldn't either, woah)
[Pre-Chorus]
I had to move back at home, my mama was heated (Buck, buck, buck)
I locked myself in the room to hide all my demons (Buck, buck, buck)
I told my uncle to give me a loan 'cause I really needed it
"Soon as I'm on, I promise I'll pay you in full"
But (Buck, buck) I didn't mean it

[Chorus]
Back when a nigga was jobless, tryna get by
Plottin' on shootin' myself (Brruh, buck, buck)
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry
Think I was losin' myself (Brruh, buck, buck, buck)
I prayed to God, and promised if he made me rich
Then I'ma stay true to myself (Buck, buck, buck)
But fuck it, I lied, and now I just stare in the mirror
Like what did I do to myself? (Brruh, buck, buck, buck)
I think the old me died
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
All the damn promises, I forgot
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied (I let the money change me, I lied)

[Verse 3]
I just put some gold Dayton's on my fuckin' Benzo
Hit the switches, told your bitch, "Come fuck me 'cause I said so"
They say, "Joyner, you done changed, you done lost your mental
You blew up and all that humble shit went out the window"
I ain't the same, I used to be different
They say that I changed, well, maybe you right
Maybe them pills the doctor prescribed me
Got me wantin' to kill, and maybe I might
Maybe my family upset 'cause I made it
'Cause no one expected that I would be famous
And just 'cause we blood don't mean we're related
I'm threatin' the plug, I'm not with the fake shit, I'm not with the— (I'm not with the—)
Grandma told me, "Tone it down," I said, "Bitch, I'm older now"
I ate at my auntie house, she think that I owe her now
Cashed my check, got paid again, make you's think I'm Oprah now
Took my girl to H&M, she told me, "It's over now" (Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck)
[Pre-Chorus]
I had to move back at home, my mama was heated (Buck, buck, buck)
I locked myself in the room to hide all my demons (Buck, buck, buck)
I told my uncle to give me a loan 'cause I really needed it
"Soon as I'm on, I promise I'll pay you in full"
But (Buck, buck) I didn't mean it

[Chorus]
Back when a nigga was jobless, tryna get by
Plottin' on shootin' myself (Brruh, buck, buck)
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry
Think I was losin' myself (Brruh, buck, buck, buck)

I let the money change me, I lied
