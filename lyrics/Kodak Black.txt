Tunnel Vision Lyrics[Intro]
Glee
(Southside)
Ayy, lil' Metro on that beat

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions
[Verse 1]
I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum, it make me fornicate, uh
I'm the shit, I need some toilet paper
Follow my player rules, then we gon' be okay
On the real, I need a bih' who gon' cooperate

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions
[Verse 2]
I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, "Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!"
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy, they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' doors

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions157Embed

No Flockin Lyrics[Intro]
Damn, that's so sad
KKK, KKK

[Verse]
Young nigga, I got old cash, spazzin' on they ass
I got Prada on my ho ass, got my last one mad
Pop a nigga like a damn tag, shoppin' on they ass
I just bought a new old Jag, yeah, it's so fast
Smokin' flocka, you a jackass, all I smoke is gas
Don't you ask me where the pole at, where yo' clothes at?
I ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, dammit, but y'all trippin', too
Is it you? Damn, my nigga, what the hell got into you?
Project Baby, y'all was skippin' in the hallway, I was skippin' school
On my Ps and Qs, on them jiggas, call me jiggaboo
Bleedin' concrete, bet you niggas won't come 'cross the street
Pardon me, I don't talk to you so don't you talk to me
I ain't dissin' on nobody, B, I'm vibin' on the beat
Honestly, I'm just tryna be, I just gotta be
Tryin' to get over on anything, they tellin' lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't gettin' on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lied to you, but don't you lie to me
It's Lil Kodak, the finesse kid, boy, who hot as me?
Told the doctor I'm a healthy kid, I smoke broccoli
I will run around your whole board like Monopoly
Ol' boy, you's a broke boy, flocka's got you beat
Chocolate, call me Reese's, can't catch me without the piece
C'est la vie, I'm ten toes down, you fallin' off your feet
I will trick yo ass for a treat, call it Halloween
Yeah, that money's what I play fo', call it lottery
Goddamn, you's a clown to me, you's a clown to me
You can't smoke no Black & Milds with me, get in the car with me
You a funny guy, don't you even joke around with me
How could it be? Get from 'round a G, you grounded from me
I'm a freeband junkie, you a junkie
You gettin' skinny, I'm gettin' chunky, gettin' money
Want some food? Boy, you hungry, I want them hundreds

I ain't gon' do the nigga shit 'cause I'm too good for features, huh
I ain't gon' fuck the nigga bitch 'cause I know she a eater, huh
Last time I wifed a bitch, she told the world I beat her, huh
And when they locked lil' Kodak up, my nigga, I couldn't believe it, huh
Ayy, lil' shawty, pop my whoadie
Pockets on Pinocchio, poking, yuh
Hit her from the back, damn, that bitch bleeding
Said that I knocked her period on
Remember when I had that poker, huh
Instead of looking over my shoulder, huh
Forces with a nigga, no Yoda, huh
That mean a young nigga got woo on me (Ayy)

In a Hellcat 'cause I'm a hell-raiser
Self-made, I don't owe a nigga nann favor
When you get that money, nigga, keep your heart
I'm slidin' in a coupe, ain't got no key to start
I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme

Girl, I'm done with you (With you)
Girl, we done, it's through (Girl, we done)
I hit that nigga for the work (I finessed his ass)
Stick and move and then I skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt (Ooh, I'm gone)
What is up with you? (What is up with you?)
I thought I said I'm done with you (I thought I said it's over)

[Verse]
When I say I keep the poker, I ain't talkin' 'bout no beans
Project baby, you know I got baby bottles full of lean
I've been through so much of shit this shit'll make a nigga sing
I remember rockin' Bugle Boy, now rock designer jeans
God dang, you just like my chain, you just like to swing
It 1k, I got 22k and all my niggas bling
Hit the club on them jiggas, you know all my niggas geeked
You'd think I'm 'bout to smack yo bitch, I made her hit her knees
Met this plug, I was talkin' 'bout he put that thing on me
I finessed him, ain't got time to let you run no game on me
Like I'm workin' out, life done dropped a lot of weight on me
I've been busy, I've been workin' hard so don't you hate on me
You my dawg then just be my dawg and don't you change on me
Don't you switch, don't you change on me, switch lanes on me
I was in that jag, now I'm pullin' up in that Range on me
I ain't in no gang, but if you run up, I'm gon' bang homie
(Kodak let it spray)
[Chorus]
Girl, I'm done with you (With you)
Girl, we done, it's through (Girl, we done)

Look, every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco
[Verse 1]
Ayy, Lil Kodak on the beat I got that bass, hoe
Ayy, boy, I drop that shit that they be waitin' for
I like the Bimmer but I'm 'bout to go cop a Wraith tho'
I done peeped your true colors, boy, you a rainbow
I got Space Jams on my feet, I'm on the moon
I'm really lit, so I ain't gotta use no auto-tune
Yeah, I'm the shit, but you know damn well I ain't number two
I'm in this bih' around some niggas who ain't got nothin' to lose
But shawty got that head, she got that fire brain
She know I love the head, I love that migraine
You ain't never run off with a boss ain't ya?
She know a nigga be stuntin' like a Power Ranger

[Chorus]
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up

Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

[Verse 2]
These ain't Ray-Bans, these Saint Laurent shades, ho
The way my niggas hit your block, you'd think it's Halo
No more home invadin' now, I'm on the radio
I don't even like to fuck, I only want fellatio
I done jumped out to that bag, baby, check my swag
Money fallin' out my ass, I got a lot of cash
Ayy, everybody runnin', nigga got a gun
I ain't makin' beats but the Draco got a drum
I don't wear no fuckin' Yeezys, I got too much sauce
Like I don't believe in Jesus, how I triple cross
I ain't even brush my teeth, but I'm on the block
I ain't even brush my teeth, all I do is floss
[Chorus]
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up

Codeine Dreaming Lyrics[Intro: Kodak Black]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I take that one all the way up
I'm about to take off on these niggas, man
And I'm codeine dreaming
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Bridge: Kodak Black]
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons behind like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche, err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah
Codeine dreams and they come true too
That's my spaceship, brp-brp!
My milky way got pregnant, she said it's for you-hoo
FaceTime Kodak with my new new, I left you 'cause he knew you
I'm wet dreaming 'bout Actavis, two new cups feel like new boobs
Tunechi

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto 'cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zorcon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron

[Chorus: Kodak Black & Lil Wayne]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling (Yeah)
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling (Yeah)

Too Many Years Lyrics[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I told my mama we gon’ be fine
So I’m up all night way after sleep time
I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga’s behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I’ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin’ all night, I’m going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5’s
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I’m on XXL, I’m in New York now

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I keep thinkin’ ‘bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
I would keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn I miss my lil one
I know sometimes I be tripping
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I’m too street for the industry
But I think that’s where I need to be
‘Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
Bitches don’t mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin’ posted on the street, gon’ call it Sesame
1K ‘til the death of me, don’t put your life in jeopardy

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind37Embed

Calling My Spirit Lyrics[Verse 1]
I put my heart in my lyrics
I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank
[Chorus]
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

[Verse 2]
I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I’m from we don’t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon
Thuggin', so fuck your opinion
I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feeling
I'm calling my spirit
[Chorus]
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits28Embed

I like my money fast, you movin' like a snail
All I smoke is L's, on that paper trail
Can't you tell? I got clientele on my Nextel
I don't need your help, got it on my own
This a million dollar phone, but I ain't got no ring tone (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Kodak, why you keep that thing on you? (Ayy, ayy)
Cause I ain't got no time to play with you
All I do is win, I hate to lose
Got your boo dancin', cause that's what them bands make her do (Make her dance)

I'm chasin' dreams, while you snorin'
Kodak Black, my bitch yellow, but her favorite color orange (Color orange, boy)
Please don't call my phone no more, I'm on tour (Bitch, I'm on tour)
Only two can fit, fuck a four door (Fuck a four door)
Nigga, this a Jag, this is not a Ford (Not a Ford)
Polo to the floor, fuck that Tom Ford (Poppin' molly)
Nigga, this a Rollie, fuck that Michael Kors (Fuck that shit)
I'm in here movin' slowly, cause I poured a four (I'm on that shit)
Got her on her knees, like "forgive me lord" (Fuck that bitch)
I remember pullin' schemes, way in Baltimore (Remember I was hittin' licks)

Why you, why you keep that tool like dat?
Why you move like dat? I hit the club 50 deep (With my niggas, ayy)
How you get so high like dat?

I.M.Y (I Miss You) Lyrics[Intro]
Damn girl, you so fine, I had missed you
I thought I was never gon' see you, dawg
Shit crazy

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
At times I thought a nigga wouldn’t ever see ya
But now I'm back out here and I won’t ever leave ya
I was wilin' with my strap, I was totin' ninas
You know I pull up in the jag I want you in a bimmer
Tell my momma you my one and only girl I need ya
Tell my baby, you my lady, I just wanna please ya
I be pullin' on yo hair when I be stroking deeper
I know you don’t like that smell when I be smoking reefer
You my favorite alphabet, they just wanna be ya
I remember poppin' checks, runnin' up the meter
I can take you to a place you thought you'd never go
I can do some things for you, you thought impossible
Man sometimes I just be thinkin' I won't ever make it
Cause I be goin' through a lot of situations
I'ma keep it real with you, girl I'm infatuated
I'ma show you that I love you I will never fake it
I remember drinking lean, living like the matrix
I always see you in my dreams, I love to see you naked
Girl you know I'm from the streets, yeah I'm a project baby
Wonderin' would you stay with me if I don’t ever make it
[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Girl I miss you, I love ya
And I can't wait to touch ya
Girl you know that I just wanna kiss you and hug ya
Hold me down when I’m gone, I got in a lil' trouble
But one day I be home and together we gon' bubble

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I'm forever your lil' hustler
You so bad I don't want to see you fuckin' with no busta
To see your face again It got me captivated
Keep it real with me what you been doing lately
I need a jump right in that pussy, I feel like a virgin
After you drop that neck I'm gonna drop some verses
I ain't seen you in so long it got me feelin' nervous
I'm sorry for leaving you, ain't do that shit on purpose

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Girl I miss you, I love ya
And I can't wait to touch ya

Pimpin Ain’t Eazy Lyrics[Intro]
Tied, they dead, flies everywhere
Y'all know that, it’s Lil Kodak, ayy, you play, you lay
Ain't no punk in me
Ain't no punk in me but I be pulling out the strap
Like I’m a dyke, or something
Niggas plottin' on us (Ayy, ayy)

[Chorus]
I be pullin' out straps on these fuck niggas
I go Young M.A. on these dumb bitches
Like a dyke man, you niggas can't fuck with me
If a nigga says it's up, then it's stuck with me
What's the principle? Pimpin' ain’t easy
I’m invincible, niggas can't beat me
Ayy, what’s the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can’t beat me
[Verse 1]
I was in the 8-5, me and Pac hittin' it
I been out six months, made four million
Slide in the 6-4, windows tinted
Nigga had to get low, them boys start hittin'
Fuck around, hit the lil' hoe with no jimmy
If a nigga say go, better go kill him
Said that Lil' Zo he cut throat with no feelings
Mama watch her lil' boy turn into a menace
I don't care, I go fed and get a life sentence
I want everybody dead, nigga no limit
I don't shake niggas' hands, 'cause I ain't friendly
When I pull up to the crib, have no panties
I been leanin' to the right, like I'm on xannies
I been thuggin' all my life, I ain't romantic
When I whip out the .45, don't panic
When I whip out the .45, don't panic

[Chorus]
I be pullin' out straps on these fuck niggas
I go Young M.A. on these dumb bitches
Like a dyke man, you niggas can't fuck with me
If a nigga says it's up, then it's stuck with me
What's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me
Ayy, what's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me

New AP, flood
Water on my butt like a tub
I got my lil' gun in the club
Don't worry about me, I'm a thug
You kill a street nigga, get a dime
If you kill a rap nigga, get a dub
Big chain on my neck, don't budge
Fuckin' DeJ Loaf like a stud
I swapped out the mic for the gun
I swapped out the ice for the mud
I swapped out the spice for the bud
Fuckin' on a dyke, I'm in love
I'm fuckin' with a dyke, she the one
Kodak don't show no remorse
I be automatic, tryna get a nigga touched
Kodak on tour, with his boys
Say they got a whole gun store on the bus
Missy Elliott, come and sex me
Hoppin' off a jet, to a cheque, to a jet-ski
I beatbox a nigga like the music
I'm thuggin' in my Reebok, I never need Gucci
I don't even see the confusion
I'm fuckin' Young M.A., long as she got a coochie
Say she got the strap and the toolie
Say she put the crack in her booty
[Chorus]
I be pullin' out straps on these fuck niggas
I go Young M.A. on these dumb bitches
Like a dyke man, you niggas can't fuck with me
If a nigga says it's up, then it's stuck with me
What's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me

Baby Girl Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm so tired of people telling you I'm doing things
I need you to stop accusing me of playing games
I been down this road before but this don't feel the same
Cause every time I hold you close it's like you ease my pain
You been riding for so long I hope you never change
Just ride with me down this road it ain't no switching lanes
It's like I'm feeling you more each and every day
I ain't letting you go don't you run away

[Verse]
Baby I won't up and leave you straight
I got your back forever I'ma make sure you straight
It's like I'm feeling you more and more every day
I'm asking God is this a blessing he just sent my way
You looking gooder than some cake I call you Anna May
Got her on her tippy-toes like she balleray
She heard I'm creeping with some hoe called Valarey
She thinking something going on she say I'm acting strange
Red Bull I'ma keep you up under my wings
I ain't saying I'm a vet but I'ma keep you tamed
Yellow baby love to squeeze her like lemonade
Running all around my mind like a skating ring
You the golden one you caught my eyes had to make you mine
Say you the chosen one you genuine you be down to ride
[Chorus]
I'm so tired of people telling you I'm doing things
I need you to stop accusing me of playing games

J Gramm on the beat
Big ol' strap like I'm a Haitian
Pompano Puff, my blower sprayin'

[Chorus]
Could you send me a flick? I'ma send you a dick pic when I'm horny
If I kiss you on yo' lips, would you tell your sisters in the mornin'?
Would you keep it a secret? Like, I ain't felt this way before
Wanna tell you that I like you, but I don't, 'cause I'm not sure
I just take her heart and score, then I love her 'til she sore
I just break her heart in fours, then I don't want her anymore
If I eat it, could I treat it? Could I beat it with my sword?
She want love and I want war

You could leave, but where you goin'?
If I hit that thing the right way can I take you to my prom?
Wanna strap you 'round to my waist and come take you to my mom
Do you get that picture? You could be lil' Kodak
You don't get the picture, girl, I'm lil' Kodak
You could be my Cheri, you could be my baby
If you lookin' for me, I be right on 18
Droppin' bands, I be poppin' bands
Poppin' Xans will make you pop your man
Park it, man, it's way too hot to dance
If you lookin' for me, I be right on 18

Yeah, I'm finna paint a picture
Finna paint me a lil' picture
What this called? Oh this the new Belaire too
This the white wine, I like the white one

[Chorus]
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I'm swaggin', I got flavor, I got sauce, call me Ragu
I love my baby girl pussy bald, call her Caillou
I clap a nigga like patty cake
[Verse 1]
Yeah, dat way
I'm 'bout to grab the Wraith, I'm 'bout to grab the key
I'm 'bout to snatch your baby girl and skeet all on her face
I got a feelin' that today gon' be a fantastic day
I'm gettin' tired of the Rollie, I think I want Patek Philippe
It's either I win or you lose, 'cause I won't accept defeat
And everybody wanna have the sauce, well I got the recipe
I'm sippin' on Belaire 'cause it make me feel like I'm on ecstasy
I love my baby, when I come home, I be rubbin' on her feet
And she be always in my chair, she hate when I be in the streets
My rims taller than my son, I'm 'bout to drop another one
You think a nigga in a band the way I hit him with that drum, ayy

[Chorus]
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I'm swaggin', I got flavor, I got sauce, call me Ragu
I love my baby girl pussy bald, call her Caillou
I clap a nigga like patty cake

[Verse 2]
My chain VVS
I'm booted up, I got more pills than a CVS
I'm the shit, baby girl, so I got stains in my drawers
All this money like a nigga hit the fuckin' Power Ball
Sippin' on champagne, my whip on Dana Dane's
No time for you lames, I'm flyer than a plane
I'm ridin' like a train, she love to give me brain
You shootin' with your eyes closed, you ain't Sniper Gang
She held me down when I was gone, I bought her Audemars Piguet
I love her like I love my brother, so I let her be my connect
I put her thick ass in the vet, ten bracelets on her neck
You know lil' Kodak love to flex, I got my momma out the 'jects
[Chorus]
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I'm swaggin', I got flavor, I got sauce, call me Ragu
I love my baby girl pussy bald, call her Caillou
I clap a nigga like patty cake20Embed

Testimony Lyrics[Intro]
I'm God-sent, I know I’m God-sent
I swear 'fore God
You know what I'm talkin’ 'bout?
Now, I done overcame so much obstacles
Came up from up under so much rocks and shit
Even though I be out here schemin' like a demon semen
I know I'm God-sent
This gotta be God

[Verse 1]
I'm God-sent, like He sent me up so I can relay these messages
Like He use me as his vessel, like He use me as an instrument
Tryna locked me in a box, they hate how God just keep on blessin' me
They locked me in a box, I pray to God this ain't my destiny
I don't drink no lean, I’m sippin’ on holy water like this my medicine
I'm a livin’ testimony, every album like a testament
Everything I went through made me who I am 'cause he be testin' me
So I'm breakin’ bread with all my fam 'cause I don't take no ecstasy
I done sacrificed my niggas 'cause none of my niggas see the best in me
They want me slingin' metal like the Devil, but I'm Heaven-sent
My brother, my mother them addicts fuck my daddy 'cause he neglected me
I'm 20 years old, but I act like I been here before, like I'm a veteran
He speak this shit through me like I'm a prophet, but I'm a reverend
Put my blood, sweat and tears in all these lyrics 'cause this my Exodus
I'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it
I'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it
[Chorus]
Ayy, blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby

[Verse 2]
I just shot a nigga, now I can't sleep
My brother, he just washed me down with bleach, oh
Project baby, snotty nose, head peezy
Now everybody 'round the world tryna be me
Miss my niggas, hope they see me on the TV
I'm on Instagram showin' off my VV's
You won't understand that this wasn't easy
I been walkin' 'round with my head peezy
Shot a nigga, took a shower with the bleach, Yahweh
Mama, I fell victim to the streets, I'm sorry
I'm in middle school; sellin' weed in the hallway
I was skippin' school, got in beef, started robbin'
Jackboy, that's my G, we like Batman and Robin
God, I know you lookin' out for me through the darkness
[Chorus]
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby16Embed

Super Gremlin Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, we could be superstars
We been rather wreckin' cars (Ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stakes for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure our time is up
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
But way more error (Huh)

[Verse 1]
Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter
Skeet off third, I'm busy
I put it in for you, I spin for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you? I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business, and spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin', you ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'
You doin' lot of cappin', watch when I catch you, I'ma whack you in front thе witness
[Chorus]
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been supеrstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

[Post-Chorus]
Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch
When I slide, nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin

[Verse 2]
Yeah, cutthroat business, KTB, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get loud, all you niggas gon' die, time rollin'
Bustin' on my opponent, no half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages, to stages, to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate me
They gon' want me dead when I'm off probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?
Y'all ain't seen nothin' yet, I promise
Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me
I be on a fuck nigga ass like Charmin
AK, twenty-inch carbon
[Chorus]
We could've been superstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

[Post-Chorus]
Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch
When I slide, nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin

[Outro]
—Glass
Yeah, we could be superstars (Super Gremlin)
But I'm pretty sure our time is up (Now your time is up)
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial
But way more error
I ain't slimy, I'm grimy
Any way you put it, I'm SG with it, I'm Super Gremlin
Snatch and grab, sneak and geek, Sniper Gang, trust
Nightmare, baby, you know I—
I bet you always see me in your dreams
