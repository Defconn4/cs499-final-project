MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends

If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way

Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy

THATS WHAT I WANT Lyrics[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
An afro, black boy with the gold teeth
With dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, comin' over to me, yeah

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I need someone who needs me
'Causе it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

[Verse 2]
Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind (My mind)
I need a baby with love in my prime
Need an adversary to my "down and marry"
Like, tell me "That's life" when I'm stressin' at night
Be like, "You'll be okay" and, "Everything is alright," uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

Brand new places I'll choose and I'll go, I know

SUN GOES DOWN Lyrics[Chorus]
I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

[Post-Chorus]
You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dyin'
Over your past mistakes (Oh)
And people who threw dirt on your name
[Verse]
Since ten, I been feelin' lonely
Had friends, but they was pickin' on me
Always thinkin', "Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?"
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged
Strangers make you feel so loved, you know?
And I'm happy by the way
That I made that jump, that leap of faith
I'm happy that it all worked out for me
I'ma make my fans so proud of me, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
[Post-Chorus]
You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dying
Over your past mistakes (Oh)

If I didn’t blow, I would've died tryna be here
If it didn't go, suicide, wouldn't be here

"You've been on my mind, you've been runnin' through it", yeah (Hallelujah)

Y'all take a rumor then y'all go and wear it out
Fuck all that talkin' 'bout who's and the whereabouts
I walk in Neiman's and Marcus, I'm buried out
Walk in the bank and say, "Fuck it, let's clear it out"

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I'm the same dollar sign slime, they gon' hear me
I'm the same dollar sign slime, they gon' feel me
I'm the same dollar sign slime, yeah
I'm the same dollar sign slime, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
Yeah, album gon' hit like it's '82
Got a new whip and it's navy blue (Navy blue)
Top of the game, only twenty-two
Look at me, nigga, then look at you (Look at you)
You just an opp and a flop of a nigga
I'm sorry that I gotta say thе truth
Thought I went pop, but I popped on you niggas
Now I'm with the hits likе I'm Babe Ruth (Ah)
Bitch, I do not do labor (Uh-huh)
You know I done got too major (Ah)
Bought a new house, few acres (Uh-huh)
I done went and got new neighbors
So fuck all that, "Nas, be considerate"
I'm really that nigga that's killin' it
Man, all of y'all niggas equivalent
I'm really that nigga that's different
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Y'all take a rumor then y'all go and wear it out
Fuck all that talkin' 'bout who's and the whereabouts
I walk in Neiman's and Marcus, I'm buried out
Walk in the bank and say, "Fuck it, let's clear it out"

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Megan Thee Stallion]
I'm the same dollar sign slime, they gon' hear me
I'm the same dollar sign slime, they gon' feel me
I'm the same dollar sign slime, yeah
I'm the same dollar sign slime (Real hot girl shit, ayy)

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
They can't stop me
Say I can't do it, bitch, watch me (Watch me)
All you lame hoes turned hatin' to a hobby
Damn, watchin' me gotta turn you on (Turn you on)
I should have my own category in porn
Ooh, I'm just such an obsession
Tea about me in IG suggestions
Thick, no add-on prosthetics
Everything about me came from genetics (Yeah)
I been gettin' money, I ain't new to this
Miss one, catch one, I ain't new to fish
But if he throwin' that rod (That rod)
And I get hooked, then you doin' your job
Baby, all these hoes imitate me
You gon' fuck a Stan or the real Slim Shady?
Toxic, suck his soul out, then block him
Got more cream than a sundae topping, ah
[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Megan Thee Stallion]
I'm the same dollar sign slime (Same slime), they gon' hear me
I'm the same dollar sign slime (Same slime), they gon' feel me
I'm the same dollar sign slime, yeah
I'm the same dollar sign slime, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah7Embed

TALES OF DOMINICA Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Woke up on the floor
Oh, this plastic bed don't blow up no more
In this broken home
Everyone becomes predictable

[Chorus]
Oh, sometimes you're angry
Sometimes you're hurting
Sometimes you're all alone
Sometimes I'm anxious
Sometimes it makes me
Feel like there's only now

[Post-Chorus]
I've been living in my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope don't fade away
I've been living on an island made from faith
Can't go running back to home, I can't face hеr face (Oh)
[Verse]
Oh, finally grown, ain't nothing like I hoped it would bе
Out on my own, I'm floating in an oceanless sea
Could I be wrong? Was everybody right about me?
Scary things in my head, I can't dream and I just

[Pre-Chorus]
Woke up on the floor
Oh, this plastic bed don't blow up no more (Ooh)
In this broken home
Everyone becomes predictable

[Chorus]
Oh, sometimes you're angry
Sometimes you're hurting
Sometimes you're all alone
Sometimes I'm anxious
Sometimes it makes me
Feel like there's only now

[Post-Chorus]
I've been living in my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope, don't fade away
I've been living on an island made from faith
Can't go running back to home, I can't face her face

LOST IN THE CITADEL Lyrics[Intro]
Tell me, are you feeling down?
Are you happy, do your dreams still seem inbound?
Tell me, are we finished now?
'Cause every time you leave you find a way to come back around

[Chorus]
I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more

[Verse 1]
My God, you're an angel
I only see you in your halo
I was hopin' we could stay close
But we no longer sing the same notes
[Pre-Chorus]
I rеmember when I mеt you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you were someone I could vent to
So I hit your line, what you getting into?

[Chorus]
I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more

[Verse 2]
Why I thought it was forever?
I only see you maybe never
Why I thought we'd be together?
When you treat it like whatever? Yeah, yeah, yeah
My love for falling down
Playing the victim when all my envisionings
Come slowly tumblin' down
Putting me back on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember when I met you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you were someone I could vent to
So I hit your line, what you getting into?
[Chorus]
I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more

[Outro]
Tell me, are you feeling down?
Are you happy, do your dreams still seem inbound?
Tell me, are we finished now?

DONT WANT IT Lyrics[Intro]
La, la
La, la
La, la
La, la

[Chorus]
If I say so, know they gon' ride
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
If I pop up, I'ma want it, but I get by
Tell the devil I can't have him inside (Woah)
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright
[Verse 1]
I smoked myself to sleep, I'm sad, I think I'm feelin' lonely
Took one too many shots last night and I spent all my money
Started thinkin', "Am I stupid to be funny
Over things that's been hauntin' me all my life?"
And I'm fuckin' living proof that if you want it
You can have anything right before your eyes

[Interlude]
And the award goes to, Lil Nas X
Lil Nas X (Lil Nas X)
Lil Nas X (Lil Nas X)
The number one song on the Billboard Hot 100, "Call Me By Your Name" by Lil Nas X

[Verse 2]
I wanted fame and I wanted riches
Wanted happiness, wanted forgiveness
Started focusin' on all these wishes
Crazy how this shit come to fruition
I've done things in my past I'm sorry for, so please don't hold me (Hold me)
Old people in my life should know that I am not the old me (The old me)

[Chorus]
If I say so, know they gon' ride (Gon' ride)
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
If I pop up, I'ma want it, but I get by (Get by)
Tell the devil I can't have him inside
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright

VOID Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello, old friend from the road
I wanted to write a note
To let you know that all in all, it ain't all what it seems
I feel like I've hit a low
One I've never hit before
Lately, I've been feeling small as the salt in the sea
Oh, it's so much to do in so little of time
I feel like I fell a little behind
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
It seems so out of reach
The place I want to be
Whoever thought I'd get there anyway?
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo

[Pre-Chorus]
I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now before I go
[Chorus]
Oh, Blue, I wrote for you
To say I'm gonna run away from home
Oh, Blue, I love you too
But today, I'm gonna run away from home

[Verse 2]
Oh, I weep through the night
Can't find a love who loves me the same
Or as much as you do
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
Oh, I reach out my hand hoping that they'll see
I'm more than what everyone tells me
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
See, I'm getting tired of the way I've been living
I'd rather die than to live with these feelings
Stuck in this world where there's so much to prove
Every win gives you more room to lose
It's too many ups and downs on the ride
I spent inordinate 'mounts of time
Trapped in a lonely, loner life
Looking for love where I'm denied

[Pre-Chorus]
I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now before I go
[Chorus]
Oh, Blue, I wrote for you
To say I'm gonna run away from home
Oh, Blue, I love you too
But today, I'm gonna run away from home

[Outro]
Away from home
Oh, oh
Today, I'm gonna run away
Today, I'm gonna run away13Embed

AM I DREAMING Lyrics[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
Every song, every dream filled with hell from beyond
As I'm sinking, I relive the story
Every try, every breakthrough and every cry
As I'm sinking, I relive the story

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
Oh, never forget me
Like I'm your favorite song
I'm fading, replaying
These thoughts I thought while sinking down
Oh, never forget me
And evеrything I've done
[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
Tears running dry, shattеred inside, but I still gotta smile
As I'm sinking, I relive the story
Glitter comes off, battered and blue, but I gotta go on
As I'm singing, I rewrite my story

[Chorus: Lil Nas X, Miley Cyrus, & Both]
Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
Oh, never forget me
Like I'm your favorite song
I'm fadin' (Fadin'), replayin' (Mmm)
These thoughts I thought while sinking down
Oh-oh-oh, never forget me
And everything I've done24Embed

Kick It Lyrics[Intro]
Bizness Boi

[Chorus]
Run to, to me, for three
See, if you need weed, get it from me
It's good
See if you want it, Nas, I got it, nigga, we should go and kick it
See you on the move, but we was cool, now don't forget it
Oh come, get weed from me
It's good

[Verse 1]
Now you all over the place
Check TL, I see your face
You just the nigga these days
My brother showed me your wave
Seen you on the TV, heard that Billboard took your chartin' place
Heard your snippets on IG, man, tell me what's the droppin' dates
My big sister love you nigga, you the G.O.A.T., my uncle say
New pack just came in, my nigga, this that cookie funnel cake
[Chorus]
Run to, to me, for three
See, if you need weed, get it from me
It's good
See if you want it, Nas, I got it, nigga, we should go and kick it
See you on the move, but we was cool, now don't forget it
Oh come, get weed from me
It's good

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Oh, you just that nigga, now, can't pick up, cool, then let me know
You ain't got no talent, nigga, more up in my pinky toe
I just thought that we could kick it, why not let me know?
You'll fall off, I'll give it, oh
Two months, give or take a whole

[Chorus]
Run to, to me, for three
See, if you need weed, get it from me
It's good
See if you want it, Nas, I got it, nigga, we should go and kick it
See you on the move, but we was cool, now don't forget it
Oh come, get weed from me
It's good34Embed
