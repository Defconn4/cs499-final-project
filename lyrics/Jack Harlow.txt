WHATS POPPIN (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
Back with the remix
These boys all my sons like Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
My city and state never ever seen this
Jimmy Neutron, I'm a young boy genius (Oh Lord, jetson made another one)
On the futon, I'ma give her that penis
When this shit's done, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, like Gilbert Arenas
Shoot my shot, I'm still with the demons, ooh
I keep it thorough
I got five chicks in New York, that means one in each borough
I'm in the pocket like Burrow
When I'm back home, though, they treat me like Robert De Niro
Took her to Taco Bell, bought her a churro
Took her home, gave her a cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year-old
Zeros on zeros on zeros (Zeros)
That's what my bank account balance say (Woo)
I got a check from the shoe company
Now I do anything that New Balance say
I bought her a plane ticket, out of state
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Said, "I'm in town today"
She said she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' that shit
So when she pull up on me, I know what she 'bout to say
[Chorus: Jack Harlow & DaBaby]
What's poppin'?
Brand-new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin' (Oh, these niggas got me fucked up, nigga)
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh, you know, it's like)
My body got rid of them toxins (Let me go, let me go, mm, mm)
SportsCenter, top ten

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Call up my bitch, tell her, "Bring me that noggin" (Brrt)
Brain real good, she a scholar
I like the thing with low mileage, good brain with no college
Call me DaBaby, no toddler (Wah)
I'm real creative and stylish, FN in my denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back from L.A. on the jet yesterday (Nyoom)
I go back and forth like I play tennis
I fuck with your ho, yeah, I'm fit for it
Still on the Billboard, the number one song in UK
And I done got so fuckin' rich, all these hoes on my dick
I still don't give a fuck what you say
She eat it like a Pac-Man, nigga (Eat it)
Whoop a nigga like I'm Batman, nigga (Eat it)
I just pulled up in the Batmobile (Nyoom)
The reason I ain't fuckin' with these rap-ass niggas
'Cause they cap-ass niggas (Cap), and they raps ain't real (Cap)
Believe me, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, need a Squeegee
These niggas watered down, they drinkin' Fiji
My whip is orange and brown like I'm in Cleveland
My bitch is Mello Yello like a soda (Soda)
These niggas tattletalers, I'm a soldier
Ayy, somebody tell them niggas that it's over
You know it's Baby, nigga
[Chorus: Jack Harlow & Tory Lanez]
What's poppin'? (Poppin')
Brand-new whip, just hopped in (Woo, hahaha)
I got options (Ayy)
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (Uh)

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Hop out that Scat and I caught her
I'm out here with somebody daughter
She callin' me daddy, I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it, I will not go kiss it
Or put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, "It's nobody harder"
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, "Email it to reach me"
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler
In case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five-star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch
That I don't ever got to stunt again, nigga, lil' Tory
[Chorus: Jack Harlow, Tory Lanez & Lil Wayne]
What's poppin'? (Canada)
Brand-new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)

Yeah, what's poppin'? (Poppin')
Brand-new phone, just dropped it (Uh)
Fuck it, I got options

I could put the ball in the end zone
Put a bad bitch and her friends on, ooh, ooh

Dark-haired bitches like Shego (Pew)
I like 'em blonde like me though (Yeah)
Although I'm Don Corleone (Brrat)

Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls (Pre-roll)
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego (She do)
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego (Can't do it)
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, "Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?" (It does)
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn (Goddamn)
Spending money at the club like Sam's (Cha-ching)
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam (Facts)
But she don't put this on the 'Gram (Nah)
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram (Ayy)
I can't switch on the fam (Bitch)
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan (Hit that shit)
This where my head is (Listen)
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (Damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (Ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' (Nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in (Packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me
And she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (Soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then (Nah)
My swag, they keep jackin' (Keep on jackin')
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin' (Quit askin')

What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)

I can see the whole city from this balcony
Back in 2019, I was outside freely, but now they got it out for me
I don't care what frat that you was in, you can't alpha me, keep dreamin'
Pineapple juice, I give her sweet, sweet, sweet semen
I know what they like so I just keep cheesin'
Hard drive full of heat seekin'
Tryna come the same day as Jack? Rethink it
You don't need Givenchy, you need Jesus
Why do y'all sleep on me? I need reasons
Uh, I got plaques in thе mail, peak season
Shout out to my UPS workers makin' surе I receive 'em
You can do it too, believe it

(Are you ready?) Ha, yes, I am
They say, "You a superstar now," damn, I guess I am
You might be the man, well, that's unless I am
Okay, I'll confess I am
Go ahead and get undressed, I am
Okay, cool, you on Sunset? (I am)
I'm 'bout to slide, okay, I'm outside, okay
This lifestyle don't got many downsides
'Cept for the lack of time I get 'round my
Family, makin' sure they never downsize
I got visions of my mom sayin', "Wait, this house mine?"
Can't lie, I'm on Angus, Cloud 9
I got 'em on the bandwagon now, 'bout time
I ain't even got no downtime
Every time I speak, she say, "Yeah, that sounds fine"

Tyler Herro Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, "My God, I wanna be in that scene"
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen (Seen)
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (Yeah, woo)
[Verse]
Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, "Shut up," like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, "Throw it on"
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, "Hell nah, boy" (Nah)
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy (Like a, like a, ooh)
[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me (Like me)
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things (Let's do it)
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing (Woo)
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, "My God, I wanna be in that scene" (That's right)
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene (Scene)
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (No, they not NSYNC, no, they not NSYNC)

[Outro]
Word to JT, no, they not NSYNC
Word to JT, no, they not NSYNC
No, they not NSYNC, no-no
No, they not NSYNC, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh37Embed

Way Out Lyrics[Intro: Jack Harlow]
Shit is the jam, shit is the jam

[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
I can tell who's on the way out (Way out)
Twenty-five shows, check the pay out
I ain't goin' home, I'ma stay out (Yeah)

I got a Dallas and an H-Town boo
Got a baddie out in Cape Town, too (Ooh, mm-mm-mm)
Whole gang eatin' steak house food
Get the check, I ain't checkin' what it came out to (Check)
I tell promoters, "I don't talk about the money
You know who to hand the еnvelope to" (That's facts)
Big John got the cash and hе been the go-to
Heard the beat, told Nickie, "Put it in the Pro Tools"
Got a fountain on the chain and it's indigo blue ('Go blue)
Might fuck around and get a gold tooth
I'm a restaurant-goer, never been to Whole Foods
She gon' listen to the song, say, "This shit a whole mood"
I'm in the mountains out West on a tour bus
Textin' this chick I used to mess with (Yeah)
Got her in the bath, doin' video shoots
Tried to send one to me, but it didn't go through (Damn)
[Chorus: Jack Harlow & Big Sean]
And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh (Ah)
What you gon' say now? Ooh

And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh (Ooh)
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, ex-girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh (Woah, woah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I get paid to do me, that's a fact check (Damn)
I run it up, then retrace my last steps (Frrp)
I'm in her eardrums talkin' 'bout assets (Yeah)
"Do you wanna?", "Yes," hol' up, I ain't even ask yet (Hol' up)
She got her hair done, she finna need it redone (Damn)
Boy, that pussy so good (So good)
Stuck it in, damn near almost made me pre-cum (Woah)
I let her give me some advice like I need some (Like I need some)
Booked up, tell a dumb bitch, "Read some" (Bitch, read some)
I'm anointed, I'm the boss
I done came out of pocket so much (Woah)
You thought that I was disjointed (God)
They pointed me towards your diss
Um, I'm disappointed (Disappointed)
My ex treat me like I ain't there (There)
What happened to the feelings and love that we still share? (Huh?)
Just like the girls who got my name tatted and covered up
I know deep down, under the surface it's still there, still there (Yeah)

And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, ex-girl got a bae now, ooh

Already Best Friends Lyrics[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
Jetson came in with a FN, two girls with him
Told me he ain't got a preference
Sat 'em both down and I asked a few questions
Met last week and they already best friends
Already best friends (Friends)
Met last week and they already best friends (Friends)
Met last week and they already best friends (Already)

[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
She's a Georgia State freshman
Told her, "I'ma pull-up at your place at ten"
Girl, you look good, I would risk everything
Makе me forget what safe sеx is
I'ma finish right now if I don't take breaths in
I recommend you don't listen to your friends
Shit ain't been the same since they stepped in
Twenty-five deep in the same section
I'm off vodka, you off Henn'
Tell me this ain't something that you do often
I can't say the same, so use caution (Use caution)
[Chorus: Jack Harlow & Chris Brown, Chris Brown]
Jetson came in with a FN, two girls with him

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Two at a time, layin' in my bed
One at the top and the other give me head
Girl on girl, I love the taste
You can run around, I love the chase
If you need a break 'cause you're thirsty
Don't trip 'cause I know you're burnin' up
She said she love me, but she want her to fu-fu-fuck it up (11:11)
Baby, make a wish and I'ma do what you want
Ain't no more intermission, I'm tryna see what you on

[Chorus: Jack Harlow & Chris Brown, Jack Harlow, Chris Brown]
Jetson came in with a FN and two girls with him (Ohhh)

Met last week and they already best friends
Already best friends (Friends)
Met last week and they already best friends (Friends, friends, friends)
Met last week and they already best friends
[Verse 3: Jack Harlow]
She brought a buddy in
"What you studying?"
"Education”
“That's where the money is.”
"You think you funny, huh?"
"Yeah, I'm the funniest"
"So what about you?"
Her friend replied, "I don't go to school"
"Okay, what you do?"
"I'm a dancer, and quick question, are you a cancer?"
I said, "Hell nah, where you dance at?"
She said, "Blue Flame, that shit be jam-packed"
I said, "Damn facts, so where y'all mans at?"
They said, "What's that?"
Smiled at each other and they both laughed
"I don't need a man, she my other half
We got somethin' not a lot of others have
And I feel like I knew her from the past
I mean, at this point, we're like lesbians"
Then they had another laugh

Nail Tech Lyrics[Intro]
Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm
Tss

[Verse 1]
My nail tech knows how to keep a lil' secret
I don't wish for my success, I speak it
I caught a buzz, and you did too, but you tweakin'
I look like I been gettin' money, I reek it
You smell me, that's LV
Walkin' 'round with my chest out, and my skin smooth, I'm healthy
I'm in the mix and I'm handshakin' but most of y'all can't help me (Nah)
Most of y'all ain't wealthy (Nope), most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all givin' off, and I'm tryna make myself less like it
This chick got a lil' Porsche body, I might let the bro test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited, I love music, and stress 'bout it
My city haulin' and I'm cosigning this wave, comin' up next out it
Ridin' 'round and this shotgun in her Tesla
Hangin' both of my legs out of it, like "What's up?" (What's up?)
I got stakes and they too high now, I can't fuck up (Can't fuck up)
I like girls that's down to Earth, so don't be stuck up (Stuck up)
I don't take Ls, I give 'em out and I chuck 'em up
First listen, they hearin' this shit like, "What the fuck?"
[Pre-Chorus]
Ten toes, that's my MO
Fam' over 'Gram, that's my MO (On my momma)
Fuck a close friends, I got friends that I keep close
And they let it go while I reload

[Chorus]
Like baow, baow, baow
TSA just opened my book-bag up and my chain hittin' like
Baow, baow, baow, baow
The king's back in his hometown, when them wheels hit and I touchdown they
Baow, baow, baow, baow
She down low, three point stance, I'm back there doin' Jack dance like
Baow, baow, baow, baow

[Verse 2]
And I'm not no fashionista, but I'm fly though (But I'm fly)
And I know I gave up drinkin', but I'm high though (But I'm high)
I told her, "I don't cum from head, but you can try though" (You can try)
I'm not on top of this shit yet, but I'm that guy though
I take a look 'round and my comp and it's just, uh (Ooh)
Wide open, big whippin', it slide open (Mm-mm)
I notice they treat me like I'm chosen (I'm chosen)
Eyes open, heart clean and my mind focused
This shit just keeps goin' how I wrote it
How the hell could you doubt us?
I mean, back then it made sense, but it's like, now what?
Now they down to come 'round just to be 'round us
You ain't one of my dawgs, why do you hound us?
It's very few of you I like, but it's a whole lot of y'all I don't trust
'Cause
[Pre-Chorus]
Ten toes, that's my MO
Fam' over 'Gram, that's my MO
Fuck a close friends, I got friends that I keep close
And they let it go while I reload

SUNDOWN Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm off a tab of that synthetic
Sundown, forty-five minutes 'til this shit set in (Whoop!)
Checking for the kid, I had to chin check him
Big mood, and we teach 'em big lessons over here (Over here!)
2fo coming heavy like we bench pressing
And I'm gon' deliver every time just like a sent message (Yuh!)
In the south and I'm feeling like a pimp
You a simp, I don't feel bad for you, I ain't sympathetic (Hey!)

[Verse]
I just hit the peak, got the kids sweatin'
Out of town chick, tryin' tell her what a Big Red is
I'm a Kentucky boy 'til the death
Go and get it through your head until it's motherfuckin' embedded (Hey!)
She said that I'm full of myself
Go ahead and bust it open, I'ma show you what a big head is (Oh yeah!)
Half of us ain't even got a whip and we tryin' grip grain
First step is go and get breaded
Hit you with the words of wisdom (Ooh!)
New Balance on me while I'm searching for sum'
Trying to touch me out in public 'cause they heard I'm the one
I peel off like my skin when it get burned in the sun (Skrt!)
Self conscious, face blush with ease
Levis put a taper on my dungarees
But I'm still on the block when its a-hundred-three
And humid in the city, but I'm sitting comfortably, yeah (Hey!)
[Chorus]
I'm off a tab of that synthetic
Sundown, forty-five minutes 'til this shit set in (Hey!)
Checking for the kid, I had to chin check him
Big mood, and we teach 'em big lessons over here
2fo coming heavy like we bench pressing
And I'm gon' deliver every time just like a sent message (Hey!)
In the south and I'm feeling like a pimp
You a simp, I don't feel bad  for you, I ain't sympathetic (Woah!)15Embed

THRU THE NIGHT Lyrics[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
Through the night
She just want the tip, no advice
On the side of the road, what's the risk? Roll the dice
If they catch us, I don't care 'cause we all gon' die (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, we all gon' die
I was worried, to be honest, but it's all goin' right
When I first laid eyes, I was awful enticed
And I might be off something, but I'm all in now
She gotta call in now
I don't think that you should work tomorrow
She said, "First of all
I'm still goin' in," like Rich Homie Quan
But with you and me, God, man, it feels so intense
I already seen that movie but I will go again with you
I got a few I been tending to
But tonight, I forgot all about 'em
[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Through the night
I would try to get it tonight
Yeah, the phone on my head like, "You better do right"
I'm alone in the bed, yeah, I know what you said
Better cope with it
Don't take me for a joke and I won't get a friend that's tryna be more than that
I'm convinced that it's sorta that
When I seen you in the pics, I could tell you was forcin' that
I got time for this
Minus the bullshit, I'm cool now, look at my common sense
And I'm just realizing this
Know my soul isn't trapped
But what's holding me back is the old me, in fact
I'ma get intact, I'ma get it back
Mama, hold me to that
Just, just, just hold me to that
On stack, me and Jack got the city on smack
That's word, huh, that's words
Used to catch 18 all the way to Newburg
It was only me and her, I don't care what you heard
Only me and her, I don't care what you heard
Got a Southern accent, she'll slur a few words
That's virtue, sir, let me share a few words
Hey, let me share a few words
Feeling unappreciated, let me cherish you first, yeah7Embed

I WANNA SEE SOME ASS Lyrics[Intro]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna—
Jetson made another one, baby

[Chorus]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, "I don't wanna move too fast"
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast

[Verse 1]
She said, "Jack, where you been at?"
On the road, but I just got back
And I'm still flyer than a bitch
And ya boyfriend, well he just not that
And I, I don't know how to behave
I'ma tell her be safe
I don't need the pussy, I'ma tell her be safe
I got God with me and he's telling me things
[Chorus]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, "I don't wanna move too fast"
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I'm just tryna' see something
I ain't gotta say it 'cause they know where we from
I got some money out the ATM, but I'm gonna keep some
Strip club, pre-cum off of the liquor, fell in love with a stripper
Now I'm asking her where she from
As if we gon' be something
I wanna be something
Take my number down, you can hit me if you need some'
Said she got three sons
Do you want four? 'Cause I need one
Do you got whores? 'Cause I'll be one
Going all night like the reruns

[Chorus]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, "I don't wanna move too fast"
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast12Embed

Face of My City Lyrics[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
I'm the face of my city
Cosigned by Diddy
Hard liquor, I'm shitty
Hotel with some biddy
Got her doing my bidding
You changed, no kidding
Wasn't always this pretty

[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
Runway me, I'm fitting, fourth-quarter, ninth inning
Ain't no way we ain't winning
Back home for a week, ain't no way we ain't sinning
If she came to stay with me, ain't no way she ain't pretty
Got the 808 hitting
Y'all some internet thugs, won't come face to face with me
Y'all would hate to play with me
Tummy tuck it one time, she'll pay to stay skinny
I done been on that road, I done ate some great Denny's, yeah
And some Cracker Barrel
Little brothеr with me selling Jack apparel
Shе a rich girl, she done had Camaros
Cheaper to keep her Willy Caballero
White boy with a little habanero
I just hit a hundred, I was at a zero
I'm a big boss, you just at a bureau
Hometown hero, tell 'em add a mural
[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
I'm the face of my city
Cosigned by Diddy (Facts)
Hard liquor, I'm shitty
Hotel with some biddy (Woo)
Got her doing my bidding
You changed, no kidding
Wasn't always this pretty

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm the man in my city (Yeah)
Niggas can't fuck with me (Nah)
Bookbag three-fifty (Cash)
Got my hand on my blicky
Might swag, I don't dance for real
First come then I'm paying her bills
Niggas bums, they got nowhere to live
I ain't chasing nothing but me some M's
I ain't beefing with them niggas, they kids
I should put 'em over my knee and spank 'em
I was thinking that they would've been thankful
Pretty bitch and she be killing them angles
We turn a killer right into a angel
I start demolishing shit when I'm angry
Boy, don't be following me, that shit dangerous
Still in apartments, my lil' hitters banging
I ran my projects before I was famous
Straight from the bottom, you know I ain't changing
Everything cash, you know how I play it
Fuck like I love her, she know I ain't staying
Pass her to dog and you know how I'm playing
Act like I'm dumb but you know I ain't crazy
Big Baby
[Chorus: Jack Harlow with Lil Baby]
I'm the face of my city
Cosigned by Diddy
Hard liquor, I'm shitty
Hotel with some biddy
Got her doing my bidding
You changed, no kidding

21C / Delta Lyrics[Part I: 21C]

[Intro: Jack Harlow]
(Don't get it)
(Yeah, we got room, we got room 'cause we fly)

[Refrain: Jack Harlow & Millie Go Lightly]
First name, last name, date of birth (Date of birth)
Make a bad bitch sign paperwork (Oh yeah)
Once the ink dries, can't say a word
Just another day at work (Keep that)
Even though I love you, you should say it first (Say it to him)
She in med school, I wanna date a nurse (Yeah)
I know you been hurt, I don't wanna make it worse
But I know that I'm liable to make it worse, yup (Ooh)
[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
Oh my, she's so fly (Fly)
Nine to five but she wanna be somebody (She needs some)
I can tell you need somebody (Some)
Put that thing on me, 'cause I need somеbody (Ah)
Girl, I'm at the 21c, come find me
I want you to bе the one I keep beside me
Baby, don't stop, can you keep massaging?
I know that you probably think I keep some thotties

[Verse 1: Jack Harlow & Millie Go Lightly]
Yeah, yeah
But that's besides the point
Got the windows tinted, can't find your boy
Lock it down after hours at a private joint (Ooh)
They treat me different in the city, I'm the pride and joy
Got a couple old flames that I'm tryna avoid
Got a couple things with me she ain't tried before
But what you waitin' on?

[Chorus: Jack Harlow, Jack Harlow & Millie Go Lightly]
Oh my, she's so fly (Fly)
Nine to five but she wanna be somebody (She needs some)

I want you to be the one I keep beside me

She in med school, I wanna date a nurse (Do it to me)
I know you been hurt, I don't wanna make it worse
But I know that I'm liable to make it worse, yup, ah

[Part II: Delta]

[Interlude: Jack Harlow]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Ah-ah

[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
I played you my first hit before it dropped
You were in the driver's seat and I was on the aux'
You made the stank face, that's how I knew it was hot
Lookin' back, I gotta wonder if you would have thought
That my life would've changed like this
That every station in America would play my shit
That I would do a remix and I could take my pick
Of any rappers that I wanted and they'd get on the shit
Hmm, I can't imagine you did
The way you see it, ain't no way that I don't have a new bitch
And it ain't fair, 'cause you know I got a whole lotta friends
That's gon' tell me who they seen you on the avenue with, uh
The playing field ain't level, that's how I engineered it
You don't know when I'ma pop up and when I'm disappearin'
Lately, it's been somethin' I don't really like in your spirit
Wallis Lane made the beat and Nickie Jon engineered it, uh
[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
She ain't flyin' in Spirit
She's a Delta bitch, not the kind with the pyramids (Ah)
You got somethin' that I'm tryna experience (Uh)
Leavin' comments, got 'em all gettin' curious
Couple phone calls, now we callin' it serious
I say I'm in love when I fall for appearances
It's a lotta clubs tryna call for appearances
Last one I did, I caught a vibe with the bottle girl

[Verse 3: Jack Harlow]
Told her that, "I'm leavin', but I'll call when I'm here again"
That was West Virginia, don't know when I'll be there again
People in my circle wonder when I'll be arrogant
Feel like they can't wait to say I stepped out of character (Ah)
She said that she wanted me to take care of her (Nah)
She said she want me to London and Paris her
She said, "Do your thing," long as I don't embarrass her
Damn, I ain't even get to test out my character (Ah, ooh)

[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
She ain't flyin' in Spirit
She's a Delta bitch, not the kind with the pyramids
You got somethin' that I'm tryna experience
Leavin' comments, got 'em all gettin' curious
Couple phone calls, now we callin' it serious
I say I'm in love when I fall for appearances
It's a lotta clubs tryna call for appearances
Last one I did, I caught a vibe with the bottle girl1Embed

Route 66 Lyrics[Intro: Jack Harlow]
Right here, mmm

[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
Bitch I'm from Kentucky but this ain't no fuckin' Dixie Chicks
This is not Route 66
She step out, take like fifty flicks
I'm way too selective with the folks that I get mixy with
She said, "That's a lie, boy"
You a thot, thot, thot
Just left out the city, it was hot, hot, hot
Think they fuckin' with me but they not, not, not
I just cannot stop
I'm 'bout to buy my bro a drop
She came to kick it with her friends
They takin' shots, shots, shots
[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
I'm a hot shot (Ayy)
Met her at the club and I took her to the casa (casa)
Get bread nonstop
Know my name, ring a bell like Raja
From the city like Rondo, Rajon
But I'm from the white side like Hassan
Way too fly but I'm not trying
Had y'all's fun but it's my time
Chain go bling
I ain't talking 'bout hotline
Young and I got time
But I finally got one, it's about time
Make the whole city shine every time that I shine
Let me know now if you not down
'Cause you left and you not 'round
Need a Julep and a hot brown
Go 'head, let that top down

[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
Bitch I'm from Kentucky but this ain't no fuckin' Dixie Chicks
This is not Route 66
She step out, take like fifty flicks
I'm way too selective with the folks that I get mixy with
She said, "That's a lie, boy"
You a thot, thot, thot
Just left out the city, it was hot, hot, hot
Think they fuckin' with me but they not, not, not
I just cannot stop
I'm 'bout to buy my bro a drop
She came to kick it with her friends
They takin' shots, shots, shots
[Verse 2: EST Gee]
Yeah, white gold over my Chrome Hearts
Ten bands sloppy, I ain't got no card
I don't feel nothing for the most part
Fat boy drive this bitch like a go-kart
Slide through the opp blocks shooting out blow darts
I been rich before I signed
Shirt cost five, wear it one time
She don't slurp, get out my ride
Run my city, you can ask my opps
Love my thots with mouths like mops
Shirt off, chains on in a drop
I spent twenty G's for a clock
Put a Bentley GT in my mouth
We don't sell CD's out this house
Still got (*bark bark*) in now
Like what's a drought, drought, drought?

[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
Bitch I'm from Kentucky but this ain't no fuckin' Dixie Chicks
This is not Route 66
She step out, take like fifty flicks
I'm way too selective with the folks that I get mixy with

Dark Knight Lyrics[Intro]
There we go, yeah
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
Boy you know what the fuck going on
Back up in this bitch, like I never left
Come on, give it to me
Sheesh!

[Verse]
Riding through the city with the windows down
Heard that you was talking 'bout him right there
Boy I swear to God you better switch pronouns
I don't ride waves, I don't switch no sound
I don't hang ten, I'm ten toes down
Had a little song I was gonna put first but boy, god damn, this an intro now
Right back to it never left though
Except for that week I had strep throat
Know this shit boom when we come down south and I had to bring my own Lil Metro
2for's on it, man the kid psychotic
If you looking for the flows or the hits, I got it
When the sun goes down I'ma creep up on it
Like a thief in the night, finna pick your pockets
I ain't really fucking with you hypebeasts (nah)
Really though, I put it on everything (everything)
I don't really be in no shindigs
I ain't been happy since 13
CyHi told me how to deal with the writer's block
Got me thinking maybe I was thinking inside the box
Now we in the house, finna bring it around the block
Know they wanna hang, but we hanging them out to dry (woo, woo, woo)
Guess he never seen this shit coming
She a little older, didn't think she be coming
Only thing I'm trying to do is keep this shit jumping
So I turned this motherfucker to a pole vault
Chicken finger plate for the road, dog
Heard that you was working on a mixtape
Really you can keep it like the coleslaw
Bring the beat back like the overalls
Your boyfriend a tool, that's a Kobalt
When I'm in the booth, make the snow fall
Ain't nobody in my class, check the role call
One name on it, bring the beat to me I'ma come skate on it
Something like Timmy, I'ma Wuntayk on it
Boy, I know this shit's hot, no one takes on it
Pre-Med shorty, turn me on like she hit the reset on me
Told me that we living different lives right now
When I graduated, it was recess for me
All these frat boys won't fuck with the boy
Even when it's really something they could come to enjoy
She don't listen to the lyrics, but she fuck with my voice
I got one-hundred situations that I want to exploit and I'ma do it
That's right, riding through the city on my last life
Know I had to beat it down last night
When she leave the crib she get baptized
Every time, funny how it all works out
Right before I did this, I was feeling burnt out
Now the whole city 'bout to get burnt down10Embed

GHOST Lyrics[Intro]
Gangsta
Gangsta Grillz

[Chorus]
I know that we got it, I might even guarantee it
When she top me up, it turn me right into a parapalegic
Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones (Ooh)
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason?
It was so abrupt, I kind of had to think that there would be one (Be one, uh)
Conversations out of state, they asking, "Where are we from?"
I don't care about ya, I got me a chick that's Caribbean

[Verse 1]
She want me to serenade her, but you know I'm bashful (Ooh)
I got all the whipper-snappers and the lil' rascals (Yeah)
Turnt up off the way we drippin' with Tabasco (Bitch, yeah, yeah)
Old friends inquiring about the cash flow (Okay, okay)
Okay, this kush here in the gaseous state
I can't hit it, if I do I might pass away
These boys fake, please quit with the masquerade, ayy
Shit, I hear what the pastors sayin'
I could prolly use a fresh start, out the window of the TARC
I'm reflectin' on life through Cherokee Park
Thinkin' 'bout life through Cherokee Park (Woo)
[Chorus]
I know that we got it, I might even guarantee it
When she top me up, it turn me right into a paraplegic
Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones (Gangsta)
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason? (Gangsta Grillz)

It's a push start, I ain't gotta put the key in
Whip it real nice like a good human being
24 East, I'm in Chattanooga, TN
Yeah, the barbecue Korean and my shorty muy bien, ayy
We just went from dive bars to The Colosseum
Man he's a try-hard, wouldn't wanna be him
PG, I'm the GM, go 'head copyright it, TM
Go 'head copyright it (Uh)

[Refrain]
Nah we don't wanna say too much (Much)
We ain't take her from you, no, she came to us
Ain't no steak dinner, but we made through brunch (We might)
2for on the beat, you know he came through clutch
Know he came through clutch (Came through)

Got Me Thinking Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't think we can be friends
I don't think that I can even pretend
We used to be such a hit
Now it just feels like a swing and a miss
You used to think I'm the shit
Sometimes I wish you could meet me again
I know you always believed in the kid
And my music and that I'd succeed and go big
And subsequently, I'll be bringing you with
We would get married, and we would be rich
Everything changed, I wasn't the same
Now you think that you believed in a myth
I cannot tell you the reason for this
Summer is coming I'm facing temptations
Maybe I'm selfish and I think with my dick
Remember we spent all of those nights in my basement
[Bridge 1]
I know that I'm really all that you want
Wish you could say "This is all that I need"
I know you see right through all of my fronts
I don't know who I've been tryin' to be
I do not think that's a problem with us
I just think that is a problem with me, me, me, yeah
I don't know when she can stand anymore
I don't know when she can stand anymore
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no-no
No-no, no, no
No-no
No-no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry we're not what you thought we could be
But it's not what you think
This is way worse than I thought it would be
I know that I'm not what I promised to be
I promised myself I'd be honest with you and I wanted to do this shit honorably
I know that you've always been honest with me
Can't help but think that I took you for granted
'Cause if there's a problem, it's gotta be me
I guess I was never prepared for the truth
Tellin' myself the decision was right
And to have no regrets 'cause I'm scared that I do
[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh
You got me thinkin' like
You got me thinkin' like
You got me thinkin' like
Ohh, ohh
You got me thinkin' like
You got me thinkin' like
You got me thinkin' like

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and now we just stuck in the grayest of areas
Thinkin' back to when I'd say I would marry you
Thinkin' back to all of them days I would stare at you
Thinkin' back when you would be drunk at a party
And I was right there I be taking good care of you
I still remember the first time I saw you
And I do not think there was a way of preparing us
For the inevitable, that's how it seems
When you go to college and I chase a dream
Eventually, you'll find a man of integrity
Someone that's better you think I could never be, uh
Probably a guy with some muscles
The type that be smokin' and drinkin' that liquor
Probably a guy with a beard, probably a fella whose penis is bigger
[Bridge 2]
I gotta get myself focused again
Sometimes it feels like you're all that I know
I know you think we should only be friends
'Cause it might just help us to soften the blow
But I don't think that I can even pretend
I do not think that I'll have that control, oh, oh
I don't know when she can stand anymore
I don't know when she can stand anymore
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no-no
No-no, no, no
No-no
No-no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry we're not what you thought we could be
But it's not what you think
This is way worse than I thought it would be
I know that I'm not what I promised to be
I promised myself I'd be honest with you and I wanted to do this shit honorably
I know that you've always been honest with me
Can't help but think that I took you for granted
'Cause if there's a problem, it's gotta be me
I guess I was never prepared for the truth
Tellin' myself the decision was right
And to have no regrets 'cause I'm scared that I do

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh
You got me thinkin' like
You got me thinkin' like
You got me thinkin' like
Ohh, ohh
You got me thinkin' like
You got me thinkin' like
You got me thinkin' like4Embed

Creme Lyrics[Intro]
I can't hold your hand this time

[Chorus]
I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky
Hit a couple spots where they know me
I am not a visit to your mommy
I got a couple mamis on call that's about me

[Verse 1]
Ask about me, ask about me, ooh
She ain't got no boundaries
Don't be surprised, baby, look at where you found me
I'm just as dirty as the shit you see around me
But you can bet they know about us
It's a circus, it's a show around us
Told me she ain't goin' out much
You don't wanna bring your ho around us, 'cause, trust
[Chorus]
I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky (Smoky)
Hit a couple spots where they know me (Know me)
I am not a visit to your mommy
I got a couple mamis on call that's about me

[Verse 2]
I apologize for making you feel special (Ooh)
Eighty-proof liquor inside of my blood vessels (Ah)
Light beams hit off the side of my watch bezel
Twenty-two and poppin', I feel like I'm on schedule, hey
Don't be so naive
Don't get in your feelings then try me, mmm
Nothin' wrong with a side piece, hey
Go ahead if you tryna leave
'Cause what's a nine to a dime piece?
What's a headache to a youngin tryna find peace?
What's one girl to a couple Siamese? (Ooh)
What's a chase when they down to come and find me? (Find me, ayy)
Never seen her 'round, said she went to Shawnee (Huh)
Told me, "This ain't really my scene"
Well, baby, this is my party and the drinks all free
So have a good time, it's on me (Why?)
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky
Hit a couple spots where they know me
I am not a visit to your mommy
I got a couple mamis on call that's about me6Embed

CODY BANKS Lyrics[Chrous]
Cody Banks in a secret agent outfit
It's a bag for the money that I'm makin' out with
Real shit, drop bombs we don't make announcements
Need a flight, that's for me, and then I say about six
Go ahead and make 'em round trip
Doing eighty-seven, trying keep away from Crown Vics
Anonymous is what she layin' down with
Puerto Rican accent and the shit sound thick

[Verse 1]
Tryin' build things, know she got a past
Why she terrified to feel pain
Big checks, I been waitin' for the real change
I don't wanna' stress 'bout trying to get the bills paid
So what the deal say, let me know your thoughts
Got an Indiana chick and I don't ever go across
I ain't really into showin' off
But the show goes on, so I'm really goin' off
So tell me how you feel, what you think and what you heard
I been, I been working out the kinks
I got New B's on my feet that I ain't purchase and they pink
Got the neck lookin' like the surface of the rink, what you think

I'ma keep this shit a thou-ou with ya'
I been tryin' take a drive and go downtown with ya', uh
Steakhouse dinner, can I chow down with ya'
Head back to the crib and put a bounce house in ya', uh
I'm talking hella kids, yeah, uh
Bitch you know I move with the elegance, yeah, uh
I'm the one that you tell the friends 'bout, uh
Used to disrespect me, you irrelevant now, uh
That's just the way it goes
Used to have the chicks and the hits with the payin' shows
Now you bring it up like that shit was just a day ago
I got love for you, I just think you should be layin' low
