Redbone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

You can have it, you can have it
If you need it, you better believe in something
We can make it, oh

You can have it, ah

IV. Sweatpants Lyrics[Verse 1: Childish Gambino & Problem]
Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked (Yeah?)
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok (Yeah?)
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
Bino so insensitive, she askin', "Why you say that?"
I'm chillin' (Yeah), real nigga feelin'
Rich kid asshole, paint me as a villain (Ma!)
Still spitting that cash flow, DJ Khaled
I got a penthouse on both coasts, pH balance
Real nigga, I rep those
Why though? 'Cause I said so
Hip deep in that Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo (What?)
You faker than some Sweet'N Low (Why?)
Yeah, you got some silverware
But really, are you eating though? (Yeah)
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so E-M-O?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese (Yeah?)
Your girl, she jockin' these (Yeah?)
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates
You niggas ain't coppin' these, niggas ain't lookin' like me (Nah)
Nah, I ain't checkin' I.D. (Nah), but I bounce 'em with no problem
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)
[Bridge: Childish Gambino & Problem]
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
Rich kid, asshole, paint me as a villain

[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Problem + Problem]
What?
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you
Fuck it, what you gon' do? (What?!)

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Different color, my passport
Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my daywear, and your girl drank my daycare
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair, it's silver spoon coon, ho
Ain't nobody sicker in my Fisker, “vroom-vroom,” ho
Ain't nobody—
(Fiskers don't make noise when they start up, just so you know)
Top of the holy totem
Ri-ri-ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, trippin' off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
And I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glasshouse in the Palisades, that A-K-A
White hood, white hood, O-K-K-K
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati, you whippin' a Kia
Spendin' this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Wakin' up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
"Err-eh-err-eh," onomatopoeia
Ohh, I got my cool on (Tailor-made)
I'm winnin', so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name
[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Problem & Problem]
What?
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you

V. 3005 Lyrics[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up

[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend, so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl, why is you lying? Girl, why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hol' up
[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So, therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs
Got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so
Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing, whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hol' up
[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Post-Chorus]
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up

Bonfire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E's
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like "nigga" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, "grrr", Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
“You're my favorite rapper now”, yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin, kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?”
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one
[Chorus]
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about

[Verse 2]
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit, "First of all, you talk white
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' "Ow"
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
'Cause all I did was act me, like a Looney Tune
And I'll give you all of me until there’s nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp, bitch364Embed

Heartbeat Lyrics[Chorus]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 1]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walkin' round naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over
When it's all over, no settlin' down
My text go to your screen, you know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sittin' at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinkin' that this song's comin' on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start callin'; you start crying
I come over; I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til it come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losin'
I'm a ghost, and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place, 'cause
[Chorus]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 2]
It's late-night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Hmm, well, two can play that game
So I'm chillin' with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing, and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want somethin' from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one-hunnid
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' 'em if she'd wanna play games
We the Super Smash Brothers, but none of 'em you
I miss the sex where you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the art of choking's
Only thing girls want when you in that smoke and light
[Chorus]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 3]
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall, and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm goin' straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J. and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money; then you burn me (Bernie), then you made off (Madoff)
She ain't a killer, but she'd fuckin' blow your head off
I know he wonderin', "What the fuck you hidin'?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden; ayo, fuck this
Are we datin'? Are we fuckin'?
Are we best friends? Are we somethin'
In between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that
[Outro]
But not really
You say the nastiest shit in bed, and it’s fuckin’ awesome309Embed

Freaks and Geeks Lyrics[Verse 1]
Alright, Gambino is a mastermind, fuck a bitch to pass the time
Mass appeal, orange rind, smoke your green, I'm spendin' mine
The beat is witches brew, but beware, this shit is potent
E.E. cummin' on her face, now that's poetry in motion
Yeah, Gambino make it work, I'm the boss, move somethin'
Yeah, this cool fuckin' suits me, swag two button
Yeah, these girls be actin' crazy when they're dancin': Black Swan
I ain't fuckin' at the club, put your clothes back on
Yeah, this beat is a disaster, 9/11 this track
Rappers wanna battle me, I have to mail their heads back
And my clique make that dinero, so it's time to meet the fuckers
I am runnin' this bitch, you are just a dog walker
Leavin' with your girl when we last seen each other
Yeah, you fuckin' with the baddest like we tag team Rihanna
Fly girl on her knees, she don't wanna come near me
Yeah, my dick is too big, there's a big bang theory
Got her picture in my iPhone, what do y'all think?
While y'all niggas masturbate, I'm in that Ariel Pink
If I am just a rapper, man, you could've fooled me
I'm the shit, when these dudes talk, they talkin' bull me, ah
[Interlude]
Yeah, rah, rah, okay

[Verse 2]
Alright, I'm down with the black girls of every single culture
Filipino, Armenian girls on my sofa
Yeah, I like a white girl, sometimes we get together
Need a thick chick though
So it's black and yellow, black and yellow
Love is a trip, but fuckin' is a sport
Are there Asian girls here? Minority report
Put your team on the map, Blake Griffin on the court
Niggas bitin' off my tracks, need a knife and a fork
We the illest, need a nurse, here's the check, grab your purse
Unless we fuckin', then I'll pay for all the food on the Earth, man
I got some pussy that was insane
So insane, it's an enemy of Batman
I'm dominant, niggas call me faggot 'cause they closeted
I'm hot as shit, comin' out the backside of a rocket ship
It's monster shit, you dudes are the opposite of Loch Nesses
Respond to this, we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin' with my n-words, say it like a white kid
Yes, your booty's big as hers, say that to my white bitch
So she don't get embarrassed, my dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin' to be fed it, I meant honeys, oh, forget it
I have worked all winter, I will not fail summer
In the back of a bush, like Gavin Rossdale's drummer
Yeah, my stinger's in her flower, I hope she let me pollinate
Workin' hard as shit, yeah, this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga, can't you tell that my sample of Adele
Was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowin' up my cell?
Swag out the ass, I'm the man, fuck chico
Took the G out your waffle, all you got left is your ego
Think about it for a second
Man, we eatin', where's your breakfast?
Man, you hungry, have this sandwich
Got my wallet, cheese, and lettuce
An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everything
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame
Runnin' the game, fuck am I sayin'?
Runnin' the Earth, give me a month
Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it
'Cause havin' an Emmy just wasn't enough
You get sloppy drunk, I stay whiskey neat
My clique should be cancelled: Freaks and Geeks272Embed

III. Telegraph Ave. (”Oakland” by Lloyd) Lyrics[Intro: Yesi Ortiz]
Power 106!
LA, it's ya girl, Yesi Ortiz
Got some brand-new music
I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think
It's Lloyd, called "Oakland", on Power 106
[Verse 1: Lloyd]
I was making Japanese and she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5 and she waits 'til I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me, "Turn around," then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
And I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland
[Chorus 1: Lloyd & Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas, I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights and the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay, babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, and oh

[Post-Chorus: Childish Gambino & Lloyd]
I don't really mind the drive
But I think I'd rather die in Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends on Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old in Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot in Oakland, in Oakland

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Everything, that I needed
Now that I got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So treated
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute
[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas, I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights and the stop signs
I'm ready to go
But I'm really not ready, girl, that's a problem
'Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know you choose to stay, and oh

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
All the girlfriends saying, "Here we go again"
Rich kid, but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes, right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah, we can try
So let's try

[Outro: Childish Gambino & Lloyd]
Whoa
I took off my nine-to-five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move
And we'll both be thirty soon in Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you
So the fuck I'm supposed to do in Oakland? In Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland

I. The Worst Guys Lyrics[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Childish Gambino]
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some
All she needed was some

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
At a Clippers game on the courtside (Side)
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five (Five)
They mad at me too, I got more fire
Why these bitches see you? "Go home, Roger"
(Go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamera in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid (Nah)
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys, and Akon
The girls that you brought, man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playing PlayStation
Why you standing there? Say some'
Girl, say some', no, this ain't a vacation
This is my house, my house, all she needed was some
[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Childish Gambino]
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna take shots? AK, nigga
When I ball, I'ma ball, King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar (Yeah), man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you wanna play pool or my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a ménage, I murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I, I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I, I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors
[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Childish Gambino]
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)
All she needed was some (All she needed was some)

[Outro: Childish Gambino & Chance The Rapper]
Oh gosh, oh my God (All she needed was some)
Oh my God (All she needed was some)
Know tonight, our neighbors (All she needed was some)
Are not alone, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Sober Lyrics[Produced by Ludwig Göransson]

[Chorus]
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high

[Verse 1]
Girl, what's your problem?
'Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time
Oh honey now girl, we can solve them
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
If you let it shine, you can free your mind
'Cause I know
[Chorus]
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high

[Verse 2]
Girl, if it's done right
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
Oh honey now girl, give it one night
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we can be
No, no, no...

And now that it's over, I'll never be sober

Oh my God, I
Let me in
Girl you really got a hold, woo!134Embed

You See Me Lyrics[Hook]
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA

[Verse 1]
I'm on my ish, call it
I watch these haters take they shots like they were alcoholics
"What is he wearing? Somebody jack that fool's steeze"
If I'm a faggot, spell it right, I got way more than two G's
Nigga I'm amazing, I'm a phenom
I'm assassin, I'ma kill y'all
I'ma say ma-ma-sa, ma-ma-ma, coo-sa
And this shit's closed now cause I ball too hard
And I'm cumming on her face, have I gone too far?
I don't know, who cares, I don't love that broad
And it's funny how these fake niggas always act hard
I'm a black star in a black car with a black card
They wanna knock me out
They tryin', nigga
Realest motherfucker in the game like Tron, nigga
Forget these white girls
I need some variation
Especially if she very Asian
She got an ugly friend? Roll solo
Can I stay at your place? No hobo
Not my fault, man, these ladies love me
She's an overachiever 'cause all she do is succeed
[Chorus]
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me, babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA

[Verse 2]
Send me naked pics, I’m gon' Tumbl' that
I’m the shit, been the shit, fuck a humble brag
Yeah we pushin’ that, and her pussycat
I got swag out my ass so I’m usin’ that
Texting with Olivia Munn, hopefully, she’ll give me some
Or some Rosie Jones, man
Hoes is hoes is hoes, man
Racks on racks on racks, man
All I got is tracks, man
Sorry for my accent, but I’ve been practicin’
Everywhere ya go niggas blastin’ that Gambino
Niggas be like, "You ain't know?"
Bitches be like, "You ain't know?"
Met this fly Latino
Hope that she eighteen though
If she not, I’ll say that I got deep throat in Heath-row

[Chorus]
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me, babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
[Verse 3]
Told me I was shit, but that shit couldn't stop me
Nigga still hungry, black Kobayashi
When I talk about you I hear a "Who?" like Horton
I was born for this shit, you a rappin' abortion
Can we hear the N-word one day and not get upset?
Can we try something new and not be suspect?
I don’t really know, we fucked up bad
You don’t wanna see my dudes when they get mad
I got a bunch of jackanapes at the back of me
That’ll lacerate anyone in the back of a matinee
And laugh while they masturbatin' all over your beaten body
Sick Boi forever, that Suburban Illuminati
Nah nigga, yeah, we never stop
No period like menopause
No period like, "Oh shit! Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"
"Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"91Embed

II. Zealots of Stockholm [Free Information] Lyrics[Intro: Childish Gambino]
When we were coming down, they said it was too soon
I never had to lie, no, no, no, no
When we were coming down, they left us all alone
We're headed nowhere, nowhere
I know you've been around, I feel you in and out
How are you? Do you sleep? Are you with me?
We used to be unspoken
Now everything is broken, I'm a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son, oh
You're a good son
Oh, you're a good son

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Arlanda, hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can vibe out for the night
Stepping outside for a light
No coke and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know 'bout photos
Let's go though
How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
Why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
The coldest dude who can't hold his Goose (Woo!)
"I'ma walk out; wanna walk too?"
What about dude?
"Fuck him, I just really wanna feel something"

[Interlude: Kilo Kish]
It took me like, five minutes to figure out
Like, where the voice memos were on the phone
But I figured it out
Okay, so, can we just–

Is it real 'cause you're online?

[Interlude]
I'm a freaky bitch
I am five-foot-eight, 390
And I am a freaky bitch

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Heathen, it's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff, puff, pass addict
Craftmatic, making moves, but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Grind 'cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same-sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost God, never pray, forgotten us
Lost love, never say it just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm walkin' in it
With a gun that they 3D printed and finish it
Kinison said, "If you gon' miss Heaven, why do it by two inches?"
Old money and new bitches
Old money and new bitches
[Outro]
Getting next level in a hotel
Ain't shit that we don’t need, nigga, oh well

Rec League, I ain't paying to ball
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah, I murder some, murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah, what you saying to it?
Old money look, no money don't do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ie
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
(At her booty) What's the rationale?
They wanna smoke niggas when they black & mild
So we acted out—okay, cool

Where, where, where, where

Blue dream by the bouquet
'Til I'm blue-faced on a Tuesday-day-day-day-day
Can I have some? #NiggasBeLike
Put a +18 on an e-vite
And I said what I felt, no re-write
Nah, nah, they can't hold me
June, July—drop something
I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers
I scorch winters, I burn autumns
Gut niggas, so Kurt Vonne
Elle Varner, got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that
Too true like it's 2 Chainz
Blue blood like he both gangs

Feels Like Summer Lyrics[Chorus]
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feel like summer
I feel like summer
I feel like summer
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
I feel like summer
She feel like summer
This feel like summer
I feel like summer

[Verse 1]
Seven billion souls that move around the sun
Rolling faster, fast and not a chance to slow down
Slow down
Men who made machines that want what they decide
Parents tryna tell their children please slow down
Slow down

I know
Oh, I know you know that pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same

You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feels like summer

I feel like summer

Every day gets hotter than the one before
Running out of water, it's about to go down
Go down
Air that kill the bees that we depend upon
Birds were made for singing
Waking up to no sound
No sound

[Refrain]
I know
Oh, I know you know my pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we change
I really thought this world could change
But it seems like the same

I know
Oh, my mind is still the same
I'm hoping that this world will change
But it just seems the same

II. Worldstar Lyrics[Intro]
"Ooh!"—"Damn!"
"Fuck outta here, dawg"—"Ooh!"
"What's up? What's up? Don't, don't try to jump me, don't try to jump me!"
"You got it, I ain't even wanna fight homies. You got it, cuz."
"Damn!"—"You got his–"

[Verse 1]
(Blow up) Worldstar before rap, you already know that
So Fresh Prince, they about to bring the show back
Listening to Kilo, weekend cost a kilo
Hair so long, I'm about to bring the fro back
Phone call gotta say "Moshi Moshi" (Moshi Moshi)
Girlfriend actin' all wishy-washy (wishy-washy)
It's your birthday, make it earthquake
Fell in love with a nigga like a mermaid
(Daddy, I love him!) That's a first date, uhh
Nobody think about it, worst case, uhh
Best case, we the front page, uhh
10K on the first day, uhh
Yeah, motherfucker, take your phone out
To record this, ain't nobody can ignore this
I'm more or less a moral-less individual
Making movies with criminals, tryin' to get them residuals
When it all go crazy
When I hear that action, I'ma be Scorsese
My nigga, hold it horizontal, man, be a professional
Damn, my nigga, be a professional, what you doing, man?
[Interlude]
Get up, get up
Get the man right here (*screams*)
Worldstar!
Worldstar! (Worldstar) Worldstar! (Worldstar)
Worldstar! Worldstar! ('star!)

[Verse 2]
My girl ain't bad, she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?
She on Hollywood and Vine, thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk (Twerk)
But I saw through it like a wet shirt (Hol' up)
Drive slow 'cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop, when I heard shots
Watching dude drop from a Glock at a—(shots fired)
Ohhh, Worldstar!
Let me flash on 'em, we all big brother now
Lil' sis, let her run around
Money talking, you know the sound—Brrt!
Money counter—Brrrt!
AK—Brrrt!
Cell phone—Brrrt! Hello?
[Interlude: Steve G. Lover]
Yo, bro, man, check out that video I just sent you, man
This shit is hilarious, man, it's like this kid, man, he got like sh–
He got like hit on the side of the head, man, he's like freakin' out

Hahaha, it's hilarious, man...

III. Life: The Biggest Troll [Andrew Auernheimer] Lyrics[Intro]
I'm fly

[Verse 1]
Man made the web, you don't need a name (Yeah)
Man made of faults, I ain't too ashamed
Every thought I had, put it in a box (Box)
Everybody see it just before the cops
Trolling, trolling, trolling these niggas
Rickrolling these niggas
They mad 'cause they don't know any better
"Hold up, it's the kid—quick, tell him he can't sit with us!"
Fuck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity
Real deep, hope they dig a nigga 'fore they bury me
Even though we were told to go where they wouldn't go
Hella slow, that's that dial-up, watch it pile up, fly
[Chorus]
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer

[Verse 2]
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha—
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean, where's the line between Donny-G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re-up
Tequila in the cantina, thirty dollars I swallowed
The Sauza so malo (I nuzzled my Nyla)
And then she said, "You need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That Camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song"
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone—now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden, this burden hurting, they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and had a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying, "Go hard"
Making dope, it's a trap; Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out; "It's the best," no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the Internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make him believe in himself, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, killing myself, no one's ever been this lost
I just get the information, retweet it or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who is this? Don't do it, where are you?
Who is this? Who is this?) I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he move with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make her dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces of shit for breakfast
Funny, the day you born, that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversatin'
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
Plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talk in the evening, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas take her props, like a musical, live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams, on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her, "I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help"
She text me, "How you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?"
I mean she right though, .45 like a lightbulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took Chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass: "You see what these labels do to me?"
Text said, "I'm wet"; I said, "Hold up, wait a minute"
H2O plus my D, that's my hood, I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gon' reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish, but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit, eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
"Life: The Biggest Troll", but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up
[Outro]
You're here now
You have to help me
You have to help me
I need you—you have to help me
You have to help me
You have to help me
Please help me
Please help me
Please, please help me
Please—155Embed

Childish Gambino got that swagger
All these pussy niggas 'round here don't matter
All that I know is that I wanna dance with ya
Move in closer before I'm gon' kiss ya
Know that you know me, don't act stupid
You seem different, tired of these groupies
I'm on fire, won't find figga
Got big shots saying, "That's that nigga"
Hovy with glasses, Weezy but geeky
Girls in the lobby tryin' to meet me
I ain't afraid to say it, yeah, I love these hoes
And their glasses, and their jacket, and their hipster clothes
Yes, I'm always on tour, what you mad at that for?
Slamming that thing like a Cadillac door
I love fast women, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Have your cake and eat it, baby, it's your birthday
[Chorus]
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh

Mama, you are with the right man, Juno
Tell me what you wanna do, I will make it happen
I just wanna get you home and (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)
Yes, I'm drinking whiskey, baby I am gone tonight
NBC is not the only thing I'm comin' on tonight
Gross, why the fuck I say these things?
It isn't over, haven't heard the chubby lady sing
Everybody love me, call a nigga Raymond
These weak niggas always in your face like Raybans
Yes, I bring the heat, girl, fire for fireman

That Power Lyrics[Chorus]
All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
So CG, but a nigga stay real though
I'm fly, I'm ill, I'm runnin' shit
3-points, field goal
Rappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell
Cause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian, bail
Yeah, they starin' at me jealous 'cause I do shows bigger
But your looks don't help like an old gold digger
Uncool, but lyrically I'm a stone-cold killer
So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut niggas
Yeah, now that's the line of the century
Niggas missed it, too busy, they lyin' 'bout penitentiary
Man, you ain't been there, nigga you been scared
And I'm still livin' single like Synclaire
Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate
When I wasn’t white enough to use your pool when I was eight
Stone Mountain, you raised me well
I’m stared at by Confederates, but hard as hell
Tight jeans, penny loafers, but I still drink a fo' dime
Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides
I’m just a kid who blowin' up with my father’s name
And every black "You're not black enough"
Is a white "you're all the same"
Mm Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes
'Cause it's Oreos, Twinkies, coconuts, delicious
How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?
I said, "I want a full house"
They said, "You got it, dude"
[Chorus]
All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though (Brra)
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Holla, holla, holla, holla at your boy
Like your dad when he's pissed off
Got flow, I could make a cripple crip walk
Niggas' breath stank, all they do is shit talk
People want a real man, I made 'em wait this long
Maybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'
And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins
How'd it happen? Honesty did it
See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit
Yeah, I bodied the limits and I deaded them fakers
Motherfuck if you hate it, cremated them haters
So, my studio be a funeral
Yeah, this is our year, oh you didn't know?
Uh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den
Man I'm Hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead
On stage wit' my family in front of me
I am what I am: everything I wanna be
[Chorus]
All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh-oh

[Spoken Word Outro]
This is on a bus back from camp
I'm thirteen and so are you
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble
It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you
And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus
And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles
I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
But I don’t know if you do or don't more-than-like me
You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer
Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh
Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her
Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
Back in the real world we don't go to the same school
And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
We won't go to the same high school
So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something
And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep
We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
That looks like a kid we know
And then I'm like, “Can I tell you something?”
And all of a sudden I'm telling you
And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
And your face is there and gone and there and gone
As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
And there's no expression on it
And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time
Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet
And regrettably, I end up using the word “destiny”
I don't remember in what context. Doesn't really matter
Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay”
I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive
And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
But there's nowhere to go because we're on a bus
So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am
I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore
The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
I turn and you're not there
Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore
We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now
Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
Just as one of them reaches my row
It used to be our row, on our way off
It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
After throwing rocks at my head
Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
She stops and looks down at me
And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face
But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”
Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
And then she turns and leads them off the bus
I didn't even know you were friends with them
I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over
So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts
This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
This is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not
I'm just saying it's what I learned
I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always
Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them
But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you
Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose
I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit
But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus
I still haven't73Embed

L.E.S. Lyrics[Chorus]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

[Verse 1]
A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on the West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
'Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different
Right, that’s why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you
Can I have this dance?
[Chorus]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

[Verse 2]
We can pretend if you want to, like
We in love and started dating at your art school
'Cause either way we both lying more than half of the time
Except for when I’m home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other, I'm taking you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
Yellow-911-Persian girl-in-the-back car
But me writin' a verse would be the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats
Watching lames handle they fame, they bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Analling anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding, stop
Girl cryin' on Ludlow, she still look good though
Love is Eastside, who are you to hate?
Movie ass; not a 10, but a super 8
You ain't see me at the show? I was super great
Hotel penthouse, gon' and let it ruminate
City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could, then I kept going
[Chorus]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
(I hope nobody catch us)
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

[Bridge]
Ooh, girl, I wanna know
Are you ready to cry? 'Cause I'm no good, no good
Ooh, girl, I wanna try
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away
And I'm tryin' to say I'm a piece of shit
Believe in this, I'm tellin' you
'Cause we barely knew what we had
I'm not that bad, the fun we had
Ooh
[Chorus]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
