Unforgettable Lyrics[Chorus: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Ooh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
[Verse 1: French Montana]
Feelin' like I'm fresh out; Boosie (Boosie)
If they want the drama, got the Uzi (Uzi)
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship (Cruise)
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies (Movies)
Ride with me, ride with me, boss (Boss)
I got a hard head, but her ass soft (Soft)
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it
[Refrain: Swae Lee & French Montana]
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi
[Chorus: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
[Verse 2: French Montana]
You ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo for 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So, you don't ever hurt nobody
Baby girl, work your body, work your body
[Refrain: Swae Lee & French Montana]
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi
Why not?

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do122Embed

Money comin', money goin', ain't like you could take it with you (Alright)
It's about to be a hit right now, fuck back then we the shit right now
Dropped Take Care, bought a mothafuckin' crib
And I'm pickin' up the keys to the bitch right now
OVO that's major shit, Toronto with me that's mayor shit
Gettin cheddar packs like K.D., OKC that's player shit
We don't dress alike, we don't rap alike
I shine different, I rhyme different
Only thing you got is some years on me
Man fuck you and your time difference
I'm Young Papi, Champagne
They know the face and they know the name
Got one watch that could prolly pay for like all your chains
And you'd owe me change, ah!
Greystone, 20 bottles that's all me
On the couch, wildin' out yelling free my niggas 'til they all free
One of my closest dawgs got three kids and they all three
But we always been that type of crew that been good without a plan B, so

I'm talkin' 'bout bone, bone, bone bone
I'm fuckin' with French, excuse my French
I lose my mind before I lose my bitch
Money ain't a thing but a chicken wing
Bitch I ball like two eyelids
YMCM beat that pussy up, stop playin'
I make her ass scream and holla like rock bands
I'm a beast, I'm off the leash
I am rich like a bitch
On my Proactiv shit, pop that pussy like a zit
I go by the name Lil Tunechi
Your girl is a groupie
And nigga, you's a square
And I will twist you like in a Rubik's
Motherfucker I'm on my skateboard
Watch me do a trick, ho
I’m 5'5" but I could 6-9
Then beat that pussy like Klitschko
It's French Montana, fuck Joe

Lockjaw Lyrics[Intro: French Montana]
My nigga, my go-to
You never told me
Montana

[Chorus: Kodak Black & French Montana]
It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak, but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
[Verse 1: Kodak Black & French Montana]
I'll chew your lil' mup, I'll boot a nigga up
Got them snipers in the dually truck and we tooly-ed up
I be tryna change my life, but the monkey on my back
I've been rollin' all night, I got a monkey on my back
Skrrt, skrrt, all about the mula ('Bout the mula)
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool off (Bling)
I know a nigga blessed, pray to God (Pray to God)
Soon as the floor hit my feet, I'm getting high (Gettin' high)
Eyes bowleg, lookin' crooked in the face
She keep lookin' in her drink, probably think the liquor laced
Nah, bitch, I'm 1K, and I'ma keep it one hundo
Bitin' down, 'bout to rip my tongue off

[Chorus: Kodak Black & French Montana]
It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black & French Montana]
Slidin' in the Cutlass and you know I paint it candy
Then I pulled up in a bucket, but I used to want a Hemi
And I'm pourin' up the brown, damn, I'm sippin' on Remy
I ain't fuckin with that white shit, I'm throwed off Henny-'enny
Pull up to the back, black Zack 'chief rockin'
And the feds keep lurkin' 'cause the boys keep talkin'
Ritz Carlton, ran off on the plug about forty times
Forty niggas strapped, we the 49ers
Bite down, Karlton Hines
Got two twin bitches doin' 69
Jump off to the mula and you know that
Fifty chains on, diamonds flashin' like Kodak
I remember totin' .38, now I got a semi
Could have been had a baby K, but I wasn't ready
Shawty say she like my Larry Pack, thought I went to Kelly
Nah, baby, I don't want the Wap, I just want the fetty

[Chorus: Kodak Black & French Montana]
It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak, but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down

Ocho Cinco Lyrics[Chorus: French Montana]
I see you niggas from the side watchin'
Got a hundred grand in my side pocket
All the hustlers love it, you know I speak the lingo
Tell a bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Face down, ass up
Pull up in that spaceship with that top down
Bitch pass out, chain light up, they blackout
I'm like "haaanh," Ocho Cinco, that's a head-banger
I see a bitch lookin' thirsty, told her go and drink up
I head hunt, that new nigga, and what
Shorty got that ocho, good head, and butt I'm like "haaanh"
All I got for bitches is pipe water
I done came up off a night order
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Bitch gave me head till my legs shake (burrr)
She gave me the brain, but that doesn't explain
Why these lames be lovin' and cuffin' these bitches
I don't know shit about 'em but they head shape
Fuck that pussy 'til her legs break
Bustin', got a dirty dozen of them brown things
Waitin' in a room like an egg crate, uhh
B-A-D boy ho
And I got B-A-D bitches for my boys so
Treat 'em like pollo, serve 'em, black Suburban
Swervin' through the hood, gettin' head like turbans
Any job a good job, so she got a blowjob
Suckin' it from nine to five, that bitch workin'
Kells

[Chorus: French Montana]
I see you niggas from the side watchin'

Man I say pimps up, hoes down
I say that to say that I only recognize these bitches
With they limbs up, or from the nose down
I tell her nose dive, then watch 'em go down
Bitch I'm cold as ice water
Put dick way down your throat until your eyes water
Lemme get that for you, lil mama cause you workin'
The way you twerkin', you gon' fuck around and get a Birkin
She like to crack the dutch down the middle, drop a purp in
Let me fuck her in the telly, screaming open up the curtains like

You know French cut, she got on French cuts
I don't French kiss, I let my friends cut
Me and Red in an all-red Benz truck

[Verse 4: Red Cafe]
I told French, I told Los, I get good head while I'm chauffeured
Momma told me, "get a nice girl with a good head on her shoulders"
Shake down, shake down, came up on them back blocks
Her face on my belt buckle, that's what I call laptop
Side niggas from the side watchin', guess they got a side view
Puff got me in this penthouse, that's my view
That's my crew, they shinin'
She only came so she could come, boss
And her first choice was the number one boss
[Chorus: French Montana]
I see you niggas from the side watchin'
Got a hundred grand in my side pocket
All the hustlers love it, you know I speak the lingo
Tell a bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco

Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco

Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco

[Verse 5: Diddy]
Yo bitch, I'm a motherfuckin' livin' legend
I'm 'bout to send these niggas through they fifth depression
In my absence niggas speaking silly
I could stand on the mountains and the streets'll feel me
Feel the rush and that Bad Boy
OBG that OG, don't OD cause that's bad boy
She feel royal when she 'round this
King Combs, now give me crown, bitch30Embed

Bringing all my jewels, how you know I start a riot
Riding with the bliquor, messing up her make up
You blowing up her phone, she ain't trying to pick up
Drinking out the bottle, I'm leaning with a model
I throw a hundred racks up, you think I hit the lotto
Riding with the wolves, I ain't talkin Minnesota
Shorty coming over, go and bend it over
Let me plank on it, put a drink on it

So I took him to the crib to kill him with it
Put my legs behind my head, I hit the ceiling with it
When I put it in his mouth I couldn't believe it
He looked me in my eyes and said he wanna breed it
Passa Passa, you ain't got no wins in mi casa

Famous Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hope no one discovers you
Hope no one sees her
I hope no one falls in love with you
I've got my reasons
'Cause if they knew what I know then I know
I wouldn't stand a chance
There's no way you would go for a man like me
If you had options

[Chorus]
Even though the world was made for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Baby live your life, just how you are
Shining star
Hope you never get famous
Flying low with the angels
They said "fake it 'till you make it"
I guess you fake when you make it
I told you "stick to the basics"
Built an empire started from the basement
If you tryna fix a glass that's broken
You know it might cut ya hand
Never want to see you with another man
Truth might eat you if you're mumbling
When it get too cold for a blanket
Need you hugging me
Because nobody gonna love you like I do

[Chorus]
Even though the world was made for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like the way I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous

All day long I stand by you
Right or wrong I stand by you
Keep me strong, oh girl it's true
Keep me strong, oh girl it's true

[Chorus]
Even though the world was made for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like  I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me
Stay home with me

Gifted Lyrics[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
All these bitches hate you
This is something I know
Because you're real enough to give it up
There ain't nothing wrong with groupie love
You're the only one I notice
It's really hard for me to focus, yeah
'Cause my body so numb
All I do is kill pain
All I do is smoke loud
Put you niggas to shame
I be rolling all day, mix it in the champagne
And these bottles all free, not a single drink paid
Because they want me, they want me in their club
But if you got the numbers, I'll be glad to show you love
'Cause, baby, I'm an XO nigga coming up
Every time they play my song, I'ma fill another cup
'Cause I'm down for whatever, I can always keep it up
All I need is some liquor just to keep a nigga up, oh yeah
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'm gifted when I'm faded
I'm faded all the time
Because I know that's when they love me
They love me when I'm high
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money
Said I'm gifted when I'm faded
I'm faded all the time
Because I know that's when they love me
They love me when I'm high
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money, oh

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I be gifted when I'm faded (Ha), faded all the time
Thought they loved me when I made it (Ha)
Niggas hated all the time, it's a dirty game
Try to find a bitch, maybe get married (Ha)
That's like pissin' in a freezer, trying to make canaries
Hawk vision, L.A. heels right on Puff Terrace
Making wishes, now I'm French kissing your bitch in Paris (Paris!)
Come and find me, Da Gianni's, that's from '92
Heard you spoil her ass when I bought her a number two
Dipping and you know it, I be pimpin' like I owe it
Come and find me now, I got an army with me now
Turn your brains oodles and noodles
For thinking you got a screw loose
I tighten you up, them coroners will button you up
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'm gifted when I'm faded
I'm faded all the time
Because I know that's when they love me
They love me when I'm high
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money
Said I'm gifted when I'm faded
I'm faded all the time
Because I know that's when they love me
They love me when I'm high
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money, oh

Put it on the scale, watch it do numbers

Got yo girl tip-toeing on my marble floors
Sitting by the pool, jumping off the diving board
Getting to the money I'mma need a money counter
So many acres, my neighbors stay in another county (Damn)

Ghosts, I pulled up in that pale thang
Got a Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain

But I'ma ball it like a napkin, tap it like it's Jazz-feet
Hold the door for me, then pop me on the ass cheek
Ain't too rich to get it poppin' in the backseat
Next time you want another bitch, you better ask me, ah

Startin' workin' out, but he gon' eat me on his cheat-day off

Pull up in the old school, boy I'm on some new shit
Red to the head, man we gettin' all that
And shorty phone answers, she don't ever call back
And I can see why these niggas hate me
Pull up in a drop and the watch 80
Pull up to the front but a nigga faded
Got a new crib and the shit gated
Came from the bottom, watch a nigga ball out
Drink it to the head, smoke 'til you fall out
Countin' up this money, nigga, keep the door locked
All my niggas gettin' to this money, no lie

[Hook: Jeremih]
Got a good thing goin' with a bad bitch
You know who to call when you need it
Wish I had another you, I'm greedy
Sometimes like that nigga get greedy
God damn I fell in love with a bad bitch
You know that every time you leave me
Even though I know how men be talkin'
I just know that nigga wanna be me
Came in here and fell in love with a bad bitch (Yeah)
Back then she ain't have shit
Now she grown up, she got ass, tits (Yeah)
Wanna know where she got that ass at
She hit my heart, a toot, toot on it (Yeah)
She got a dump truck, I put a boot on it
Don't mind spendin' this loot on it (Yeah)
Treat her like my whip, I put some shoes on her, yeah43Embed

Shawty in the way, got the mothafuckin' fix, yeah

House on my neck, 'nother house on my wristband
Girls really love me like a mothafuckin' six pack
No time for restin' (restin')
My life's invested in bein' a fuckin' legend (legend)
An icon, tryna cement it ('ment it)
I'm treatin' every year like it's game 7 (game 7)
I feel like problems in my city been deaded (deaded)
I feel like me and my niggas are unthreatened (threatened)
My new girl hate it when I'm always spendin' (all the time)
I guess I gotta get used to it 'cause of my exes
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)

I got it a little cheap, baby you should come and play
Daddy will pay the cab, maybe stay for a day
No one got it but me
Bitches, they call me whore, son, more buns
Mami bent over for hum
Give her, what she want and let her get it good
Put it on her tongue
Told me, "Charly, boy you gotta give
Fix me with a lot of dick
Hit me with a lot of kick
Show me you the man"
Bustin' quickies and dippin'
That be somethin' I can't stand
Other plans, baby, had of late
Tried to put me in a twirl like the Cheerio
I ain't talkin' cereal
Put me in a video, I can make a wave
Baby girl, comin' home and you can't stay, oww

Figure It Out Lyrics[Intro: Kanye West & Nas]
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
(Yeah)
No matter how many times I've tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I never lied to you (Uh) I can’t
(Can’t lie y’all, he disrespected y’all)
No matter how times I’ve tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can’t lie to you, I can’t
Always on my mind, I can feel it now

[Verse 1: Kanye West & French Montana]
Uh, just like a nigga, go figure
Some shit they said they might never figure
Mo’ figures, more hating ass niggas
Mo’ commas, more hating ass problems
[Hook: Kanye West + We are the Take + French Montana]
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
No matter how much I’ve tried
No matter how much I’ve tried
Can’t lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
Uh, no matter how many times I’ve, uh
No matter how many rhymes I’ve, uh
I got it all in my mind, ah uh

Eh, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can’t figure it out
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Coming from the back block, posted like the backdrop
Rags to the riches, got rich and bought the ragtop
Lot of homies died here, look at what the grind did
Put me in the same shoes, still do what Shyne did
More digits, more bitches, more riches
They don’t want no broke niggas
But don’t call them gold diggers
I don’t know, I don’t know, why I ain't get the picture?
Why Cosby slipped her?
Why I fucked ‘em both when they said they sisters?
Why Eazy ain’t have the Magic?
Why AI never won a 'ship?
And why God took Max and Chinx
And he ain’t take me when I got hit?
[Hook: Kanye West + We are the Take]
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
No matter how much I’ve tried
No matter how much I’ve tried
Can’t lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out

No matter how many rhymes I’ve, uh
I got it all in my mind, ah uh

Eh, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can’t figure it out
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah

[Verse 3: Nas & Kanye West]
Beyond Pérignon, the fame, the money
The Baccarat crystal that’s hanging from the ceilings above me
Hearing people whisper, screaming I’m lucky but trust me
Nothing come free, shawty tried to keep my son from me
Or I could be delirious to take life serious
Remain single forever, can’t wife nothing, period
I’m a G, I need privacy, media’s never kind to me
Niggas beefing on small time things, we on a dying spree
He disrespected y’all
Just like a nigga, go figure
He talking reckless, yo
I can’t accept it, yo
No matter how much I’ve tried
For the love of my people, I guess I'll let it go
I can’t figure it out
[Hook: Kanye West + We are the Take]
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
No matter how much I’ve tried
No matter how much I’ve tried
Can’t lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
Uh, no matter how many times I’ve, uh
No matter how many rhymes I’ve, uh
I got it all in my mind, ah uh
I got it all in my mind, ah uh
Always on my mind
Eh, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can’t figure it out
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah

Coke boy
Montana (Black Metaphor)
[Chorus]
Uh
You already know that
All this money I be staring at

You know what I mean? Sanctuary, baby
You know what they say
It's the game of life
And you don't get to play it twice
You heard? (Black Metaphor)

[Verse 1]
A car, big mansion, and the bezel (Uh)
Trying to make a deal with the Devil (Devil)
I want it all
Born to lose, ain't it? (Ain't it?)
Rules in engagement
Glued to the pavement
Sell it all
My first flip was when the needle hit my vein (Huh?)
Lost it all, it's when the drugs fixed the pain (Huh?)
Pray for me tatted on my neck
Fuck money, I was dying for my respect
I was high, getting wet was a way of life
Stranded on the block, fiends buying work, only thing in sight
Had to pay the light
Mama working three jobs
Father leaning, he high
My home boy on the run, he hot
Montana
[Chorus]
Uh
You already know that
All this money I be staring at

All this money I be staring at, ooh

Bring the drugs, baby, I'ma bring my pain
You already know that
All this money I be staring at, ooh
All this money I be staring at, ooh

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Head shot, didn't die, God got a plan for you (Huh?)
Bounce back, hit the block, OG got them grams for you (Oh)
Did it on your own, nobody gave a hand to you (Nah)
Now you hot, spitting bars, shows thirty grand for you (Woo)
God protect the child that can hold his own (Huh?)
Almost lost it all for everything he own (Huh?)
Put that on everything (Thing)
Thought I knew it all, but I ain't know anything (Anything)
Did it with my dawgs, had to get my weight up
Pick the K's up
Hundred round, homie, lift your braids up
Never put my legs up
I'm working now
It's working out
They wonder how
Hundred miles running, nigga gunning 'til the sun is out
[Chorus]
Uh
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
You already know that
All this money I be staring at, ooh
All this money I be staring at, ooh
Bring your love, baby, I'ma bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I'ma bring my pain
You already know that

Talking brown bag, paper tag off the rip

Dope boy back, popping tags off the rip, nigga off the rip
Started from the block, dirty money off the rip
Cut a shark fin, talking money off the rip
Walk up on the dealer, a hundred fifty off the rip
My dog came home, buck fifty off the rip
Haan!

Rari looking good on the strip
Talk a hundred mill as I mothafucking grip
Johnny Hancock, ten milli off the rip
Shawty bought her friends off the rip
Bitch bust it open, eating pussy off the rip
Westside, getting blood money with a crip
My dog getting out, money orders off the rip, boy
Spend a car note on my fit, boy
Manute Bol hanging off my clip, boy
Niggas running like a skit, boy
I'll push you on my skit, boy
On my wrist is a brick, boy
Built the empire brick by brick, boy
Coke Boys off the rip, boy

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Started with a hooptie and I went and got a Bimmer
Pull up in a boat, titanic La Marina
Shout out to young gunner, spend a hundred on my timer
Looking through the smoke and mirrors, smoking marijuana
'Rari and the 'Gatti and the Bimmers and the Benzes
Homicide tryna knock my door off the hinges
Riding with some cubans that be fresh up out that border
Making back a whole thang, breaking down a quarter
Drophead, getting dome, riding through New Orleans
Hear them shots ringing then I hit that money caller
Counting up my blessings, counting money keep a dollar
Drophead white mink on when it's cold out

Fuck What Happens Tonight Lyrics[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Fuck all that ho shit
Fuck all you fuck boys
Bitch, we're real hustlers
Get money...
It's We The Best music, Bad Boy, Coke Boyz

[Chorus: Mavado]
I got my gun on me, I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me, death row Jamaicans, murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight, fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight, I've got my gun on me

[Verse 1: French Montana]
It was murder she wrote, your name in blood
When the love's gone, your eyes diluted full of blood
Six cars full of goons, six blocks heard the boom
Dreadlocks, middle of June, head shots, get tombed
Stone, ten shots, five gone, 9/11 dial tone
You want it all, die alone
A war's going on nobody's safe from
Now we're talking to the judge when your day come
Like it was hard not to kill these niggas
It was like a full-time job not to kill these niggas
Eight figures, need the eight story mansion
While I'm strapped up two-stepping with the devil dancing
Diluted with blood in my eyes
Like a stillborn, niggas won't make it out alive, nigga
[Chorus: Mavado & Ace Hood]
I got my gun on me, I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me, death row Jamaicans, murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight, fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight, I've got my gun on me (Ace Hood!)

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Fuck it, I'm ready to die tonight
Put it on mom with that clip on my back and I loaded it twice
Just a call away, my niggas is ready, no matter the price
Playing with mine, you niggas could get it including your wife
Isn't life a motherfucker?
Since seventeen that pistol's been my blood brother
Sleeping with that lethal weapon, playing Danny Glover
AK40, own a hundred if we're talking numbers
Riders' fucking with mobsters
Niggas want beef? Turn them to pasta
Load up the clip, shoot up your master
Bang bang, bless them father
Passed beside him, rest aside a lake
That's swimming with snakes inside
Look at my eyes, I hate disguises
Knife or gun, I compromise it
Oh Lord, I'm a ride on my enemies
If I die tonight, I bet them gangsters remember me
Nigga, until then...
[Chorus: Mavado]
I got my gun on me, I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me, death row Jamaicans, murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight, fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight, I've got my gun on me

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
From the depths of the sea, back to the block
With a bitch on my dick and a bottle of Ciroc
Tick tock, non-stop, blocker, blocker, blood clot
Don't test the lion cause you'll get dropped on the spot
Lick shot, drip drop over the soil
Pot's hot until it boils
To this Crip shit, I'm loyal
Dip with us, ride with us, slide with us, sleep with us
Sit with us, fuck with us, bad lil bitch’s better get with us
She likes the French tip nails that I wear
And how I'm so pimped out with dreads in my hair, yeah
You got truth, now the truth is to dare
Blue bandana, it's me and Montana
At the Tropicana with Tanehsa, Alisha, Lakesha, Savannah
Nicknames for my blammer

[Chorus: Mavado]
I got my gun on me, I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me, death row Jamaicans, murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight, fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight, I've got my gun on me
[Verse 4: Scarface]
The smell of blood in the bathroom
Body layed out stiff full of stab wounds
I told this nigga I was coming back
Pussy must not have heard when I told him that
Nigga, it's eye for an eye
A life for a life, a body for a price
I want to smell his last breath took
And look him in the eyes and make for sure he knows how death looks
Because I'm him, it's in the air, I can feel it
Shot him four times with the gun I was concealing
Overkilling, it ain't no coming back from it
Then walked away with a demeanour like I just done it
Something evil this way's coming
For big face hundreds this bitch gets punished

[Chorus: Mavado]
I got my gun on me, I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me, death row Jamaicans, murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight, fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight, I've got my gun on me9Embed

So High Lyrics[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Penning these lyrics from a hammock
With an ounce of kush, a pack of bamboos
And an ice cream sandwich, I'm that dude
Game given to you from an OG point of view
Usually I'll sell it, but I got enough to share with you
Baby, if you cook and roll that weed, I'll be so happy with you
Fuck you so good, you'll know I'm cheating, it won't matter to you
You know how daddy do you, Spitta make them jet maneuvers
Hop out the club, don't park valet, won't get a chance to move it
I'm out before I hear the music, that's how quick them hoes be choosing
I don't call it, pussy be crawling to me
Homeboy, I don't know who did what, cause I was in the cut
Rolling tropical, sitting low as possible

[Chorus: French Montana]
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
(Sample: Without any sun, lotus blossom don't cry)
[Verse 2: French Montana]
Shorty pussy be the meanest, I be balling all arenas
Homie high somewhere in Venus, I mean this
When I tell you that I want it, I don't need it
They be nulling the procedures, shorty yelling from the bleachers
Got me reaching like a two guard, too hard, ski mask or a suit on
Five chains, canaries help me cool off, tuned off
Camaro like Larry Flynt, block-star, rockstar
Montana Aerosmith, forty spit
Homie niggas dying, I'll be flying out
Feds on my nigga's tail, he hiding out, Montana sliding out
Baby, don't be fucking with my high, suck a nigga dry
I'll be low as possible, trying to clear my mind
Montana, bitch

[Chorus: French Montana]
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible7Embed
