Honest, so hot, mind on a comet
Fast life sometimes feel like I'm in a comic
I don’t give a fuck bitch, with or without a condom
Fat Joe, pockets lean back like a recliner
I'm in this, representin' West Side
Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy
Bat Gang, got it tatted by my left eye
Chain gang over here, no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business
From beginning to the ending never simpin', never slippin
Sipping P-A-T-R-O-to the-N
And if I'm in the building know it's complaints from the tenants
On the real

How you make it to my section in the first place?
Nah, I ain't trippin', shit is nada
They say it ain’t trickin' if you got it

Rock Tom Ford and I still pop Molly
Roll up good Cali, la di da di

At your door like The Shining, egh
Feel like can't nobody stop me, I'm a hot nigga
Uh and the bitch that I'm with know she hot stuff
Pull up in the Hot Wheels, ballin'  get yo hops up
If you got a problem get a hotline

Money and the Power Lyrics[Intro: Kid Ink]
Money and the power
Once you get a 'lil they just want to take you down (cause)
I got the money and the power
Once you get a 'lil they just want to take you down (cause)
We’ve been going hard for too long
Can’t get enough, what is you on?
Really ain’t nothing, I could drop that
Wake up in the morning, make it all back

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
It’s nothing, nothing to get it poppin’
Wanna roll. Roll up, up, and away
Here we go now
Now Martin had a dream, I’ve been dreamin’ ’bout gold
Tell ‘em I just wanna shine, and I gotta let it show
Show up on the scene, walk right through the door
Got a nigga on repeat, it’s my double up flow
Vibrate the whole building, I ain’t ringing through your phone
Waiting ’til the smoke clear, can you see me through the fog?
Fall back, it could go all bad
We be goin’ hard with your ex, oh Tic-tac
Tacky motherfuckers must not be hip yet
Life is a bitch, but I bet I get that bitch wet
[Hook: Kid Ink]
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Can’t get enough, what is you on? (Yeah)
Really ain’t nothing, I can drop that
Wake up in the morning, make it all back
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Ma-money and the power
Once you get a little, they just wanna take you down (cause)

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
But I’m ready, ready, so you can tell ‘em to bring it on
On a whole other level of high, no phone
Foes all mad ’cause the dough don’t fold
Forget about your plans, we ain’t leavin’ ’til it close
Close to the top, I can barely see the ground
With the whole team here, everybody get around
Look like a parade when we’re coming through your town
One hand to the sky, two feet to the ground
Wait, can’t stop ’til the sun’s up
Party everywhere ever since I got my funds up
Yup, pray to God it never run out
Off that loud, burnin’ rubber, need to slow it down

[Hook: Kid Ink]
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Can’t get enough, what is you on? (Yeah)
Really ain’t nothing, I can drop that
Wake up in the morning, make it all back
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Ma-money and the power
Once you get a little, they just wanna take you down (cause)
[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Mon-money and the power
Once you get a little, they just wanna take you down
Mon-money and the power
Once you get a little, they just wanna take you down
That, that’s how it is
When you fuckin’ with me, you should know how it goes
That, that’s how it is
I’ve got a bottle in my hand and a pocket full of dough

[Outro: Kid Ink]
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Can’t get enough, what is you on? (Yeah)
Really ain’t nothing, I can drop that
Wake up in the morning, make it all back
We, we’ve been going hard for too long

Badass Lyrics[Produced by Devin Cruise]

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I'm feeling like a man of the hour, tear down the house
Throwin' this money like it's no running out

Get high as you ever been (go), we getting hella bent (go)
Ball so hard, I deserve me a letterman
Now then let me see that cake, cake, cake, like Entenmann's

Real late night, no cat naps, you so acrobatic
Just move it 'til the bass slap the bass slap like the Mac S
No question we turnt up, workin' on my fourth cup
Then throwin' all this money like the ass is for purchase
Very important persons, don't take it too personal
Got more bottles than homies, it's a movie, ready for the show

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I'm feeling like a man of the hour, tear down the house
Throwin' this money like it's no running out
Okay, but I wanna know, can you get any higher?
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass

Bottles, kush blowin' like a whistling referee
Take a shot don't be afraid, girl just put on for your team

Sunset Lyrics[Intro]
Egh, yeah, okay

[Bridge]
Now, just picture me, high up with my top down
On Highland and Sunset, doing 85 on the top deck
See, step by step we walking on stars
If you're looking for some action, you ain't gotta go that far

[Chorus]
Now, just picture me Hollywood living
Riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now, stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down
Man, you know how it go down, man, you know how it go down
I'll entertain ya, just wait until the sun goes down
You know how it go down, you know how it go down
Might get a little crazy, just wait until the sun goes down
[Verse 1]
Underground, any city I come in town
It's touchdown, Hail Mary, getting to the dough like Pillsbury
All night, don't feel worried, high up is where we will be
Nah, you ain't gotta feel guilty, won't judge you, gon' be free
So pour what you want, go head, roll what you want
Fuck they say somebody walking 'round here like they somebody
Don't know what kind of day I had, with all this weight, couldn't hold my bag
Don't hold me back from my habits, live the fast life for the magic
I'm just looking 'round for the baddest Hollywood face with an ass from Dallas
Big-ass crib, nigga living in a palace
We rolling out and my hands on the wheel so tight, got a callus
Get so fabulous with everybody here, only thing that matters

[Chorus]
Now, just picture me Hollywood living
Riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now, stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down
Man, you know how it go down, man, you know how it go down
I'll entertain ya, just wait until the sun goes down
You know how it go down, you know how it go down
Might get a little crazy, just wait until the sun goes down

[Verse 2]
And it's go time, I swear this feeling's like we inches from the goal line
Now or never, better make your mind
Might hit her with a line like "What's your sign?" Hit her with a glass of sparkling wine
Hit her on the ass, she might not mind, acting like a 10, look more like a 9, but
Don't be stuck up, really, how could you not see us?
Doing it big, it's obvious, you ain't gotta say much, cause
I know you're sick and tired, sick and tired of all that bullshit
Then don't be afraid, take a shot and bite the bullet
That's one in the hole, can't get enough, need one or two more
Tell 'em catch up, they're running to slow, out the gutter, I learned to bowl
And finally it's movie time to show them I play the role
Of a champion, you see the goal, light shine bright, can't see the road
[Chorus]
Now, just picture me Hollywood living
Riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now, stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down
Just picture me Hollywood living
Riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now, stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down
Man, you know how it go down, man, you know how it go down
I'll entertain ya, just wait until the sun goes down
You know how it go down, you know how it go down
Might get a little crazy, just wait until the sun goes down45Embed

Hell & Back Lyrics[Intro]
Said you can tell' em that
I been from uh uh
When the heat is on
You know I give back
I said uh uh, yeahh, yeah

[Chorus]
You can tell them that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your lighters at
Just burn it down
F-f-fire back
[Verse 1]
Uh, let's take it to the ground
Don't too many make it coming through our town
Looking for a detour nowhere to be found
When the pressure's on seems nobody's around
Uh, but I won't let them see me sweat
Yeah it took a little time
But can't really be upset
Long way to the top
I can barely see the steps
Yeah, they sleeping on me still
But I barely need to rest
See me standing here, head high
Face up, I don't need no X-Ray
Show you what I'm made of
Tell 'em I paid my dues
You can check the pay stubs
Never had a chance so
I had to go and make one
Say some, you can tell them that
I've been through hell and back
But I'm home, can't really complain when
It's the life that I chose
Sacrificed it all and everything that I owned
Say "What doesn't kill me can only make me stronger"
[Chorus]
You can tell them that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your lighters at
Just burn it down
F-f-fire back

[Verse 2]
Yo can you feel the heat
The block is hot as ever
In these city streets
You only get one shot
Keep your arm steady
They tried to make me wait
But I'm more than ready
To go and get my, grind like an inline
Skater check your wrist watch you'll see that
This time it's my time
And I don't need no invite
To the party, got roll over minutes and
Feels like my calling, oww
I'm just doing what I can
With a whole lot of drive
Trying to make my own path
Take a chance, can't sit and worry about
No 5-year plan gotta live for the day
Cause I could die where I stand
Tell 'em
You can tell them that
I've been through hell and back
But I'm home, can't really complain when
It's the life that I chose
Sacrificed it all and everything that I owned
Say "What doesn't kill me can only make me stronger"
[Chorus]
You can tell them that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your lighters at
Just burn it down

No Miracles Lyrics[Chorus: Elle Varner]
I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles…
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I ain't afraid, knowing shit’s gotta change
One day it’ll never be the same
Just look into my heart you can see the grind
Look into my eyes you can see the pain
Painted a perfect picture where I came from
Some nights when I thought I wouldn’t see the sun
Son raised, though daddy wasn’t home, word
Hard tryna hold it down like a short skirt
Skurr off from these niggas tryna hold me back
I will not lose, Hov told me that
Dreaming bout a moment that’ll change my life
I don’t never wanna wake up, turn off the lights
Gotta let it burn, I’ve been ready to ignite
I said nothing’s impossible
See me runnin through the city, no obstacles
No option two, one way to go
[Chorus: Elle Varner]
I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles…
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I ain’t afraid, it’s nothing more I gotta say
To them haters middle finger, up to yo face
Facing so many problems, hate being tested
From a place where they waiting to see me arrested
No rest, tryna make it where I wanna go
Alumni but I couldn’t make the honor roll
Too cool for school, I’m too rude for Jude
There’s no rules in the life we choose
I gotta ride for something, gotta die for something
Say you only live once, we’ll I keep it 100
Mo money, mo problems keep on coming
Tryin, a nigga go back but these niggas keep frontin
Right now everything going right, it could fuck up tonight though
Said nothing’s impossible
See me runnin through the city, no obstacles
No option two, one way to go
[Chorus: Elle Varner]
I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles…
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
I ain’t afraid, I’m already dead
I just don’t know when we goin'
It’s crazy how the devil gets us when we heaven-sent
My hands already red, I lost so many men
Heavy is the head that wears the crown that I’m wearin' man
I was a loser just tryna fit in a letterman
But those were school days, I grew up, now I’m on Letterman
I never thought that a song I wrote in a minivan
Would ever have the impact I’m reading inside these letters man
"Dear Kells I heard yo story and felt it man
Your voice inspires, I feel like I can do anything
By the way, I sent you something from my brother"
Open it up, a razor fell, he was a cutter, damn!
What if you were me, in 2003?
Rap was just a dream baggy jeans, burning blank CD’s, feed 'em to the streets
Would you let adversity hide you? Or, conformity guide you?
Or realize everything you need’s inside you?
[Chorus: Elle Varner]
I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles…
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no
I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles…
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no53Embed

Hoes ain't loyal and never keep it lowkey

Take it to the hotel, baby, leave with me

I said why you over there lookin' at me
While I'm with my girlfriend??

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's kinda hard when I see you lookin' over here with them eyes
I got a girl but I'm feeling your body, so I'ma have to just play both sides
I hope she don't come over here 'cause I'm with my girl, you know I love her
I got two of my bitches in the club and they know about each other, oh, no

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Uh, but a nigga never Paranoid
You fuckin' with a man, not a little boy
What? I could barely hear your lil' voice
In the club but your body makin' all the noise
Clap it up, stack it up
Baby, where your purse? Just pack it up
And grab her hand, tell her we should go now
If you really wanna take this party to the hotel
[Chorus: Kid Ink, Chris Brown & Both]
I said why you over there lookin' at me (whoop)
While I'm with my girlfriend?
Why you over there lookin' at me and my girlfriend?
Let's take it to the hotel, we could take it there (oh, woah, woah)
Let's take it to the hotel, baby, we could take it there (oh, woah, woah)
Take it to the hotel, baby, leave with me
Know I got a penthouse suite
I said why you over there lookin' at me
While I'm with my girlfriend??

[Verse 4: Kid Ink]
Over there lookin' all suspicious
Get a clue, girl, don't be a mystery
I see you likin' on all my pictures
Of me and my bitch up in all of our business (woah)
So, you gotta know it ain't a limit to
What a pill and the liquor do (nah)
Make a straight girl go down, just spit down
I might fuck around and lick her too
It ain't a problem, my metabolism high
Eat you both up for dinner (woah)
Just keep it real with a real motherfucker
Ain't got time for no pretenders
Now just bring it to me
That fleek, that freak, no classy stuff (uh)
Been pushin' up, don't pussy out (uh)
Bitch, what you really on? (Nah, what?)
[Chorus: Kid Ink, Chris Brown & Both]
Why you over there lookin' at me (whoop)
While I'm with my girlfriend?
Why you over there lookin' at me and my girlfriend?
Let's take it to the hotel, we could take it there (oh, woah, woah)
Let's take it to the hotel, baby, we could take it there (oh, woah, woah)
Take it to the hotel, baby, leave with me
Know I got a penthouse suite
I said why you over there lookin' at me
While I'm with my girlfriend??73Embed

Iz U Down Lyrics[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I could tell by the way you’ve been lookin' at yo girlfriend
I could tell by the way you’ve been dancing wit' yo girlfriend
Can I ask iz u down? Iz u down? (uhh, uhh)
Iz u down? Iz u down?
Can I ask iz u down? Iz u down? (Kid Ink)
Iz u down? Iz u down?

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Now it ain’t hard to tell by the way you’ve been lookin at her face
It’s something on yo expression lookin like you need a taste of that ass
Take the grab, it’s nothing that I can say
It’s a lot up on her plate, I’ve been ready, hit the bass
Hit it, Owww
Guess who back in the build with a motherfuckin problem
Top of the world, all the way from the bottom
Turn this whole bitch up like fox and go in, show out
I seen them kissing pics of you and yo girlfriend
Tryna get yo likes up but this shit been helping
Got a question, how many drinks do it take til you start getting touchy feely?
Gotta make sure I pay them both attention or one of em gon kill me
Tell the truth, whole truth, no undercover freak, I’m guilty
Check please, pay the cost to be the boss, just bill me
[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I could tell by the way you’ve been lookin' at yo girlfriend
I could tell by the way you’ve been dancing wit' yo girlfriend
Can I ask iz u down? Iz u down? (One question)
Iz u down? Iz u down? (Can I ask?)
Can I ask iz u down? Iz u down? (One question)
Iz u down? Iz u down?

[Verse 2: Tyga]
AHHHH, can I have that? You and yo best friend on a mattress
Ass so fat, need a lap dance, that was way back then
Lost a little weight but that ass still thick, goddamn
So innocent, I’m a guilty trip, she ride the dick, it be worth the trip
No antics, no romantic shit, just friends with benefits
I'll take that (take that)
Never seen a roof come back on a Maybach, I don’t think you seen that
Who you tryna meet back, I could put you anywhere
Fly private air, ooh yea
Who do dare take you from me?
Can’t compare, my fashion rare
All I wear, Last Kings gear, man that shit so ill
I just wanna take you girls home
Make a nasty song and put this shit online
We could do it like Kid 'N' Play
Have a house party, all night long
Iz U Down is my theme song
Take yo thong off, put me on
T-T-Raww, I been a dog, so gon' let a nigga bone
[Bridge]
Cause I can tell by the way, tell tell by the way
I could tell by the, I could tell tell by the by the
I could tell by the way, tell tell by the way
I could tell by the, I could tell tell by the way
I could tell by the way you’ve been lookin at yo girlfriend (Ha!)
I could tell by the way you’ve been dancing wit yo girlfriend
(Word up, ha!)

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I could tell from how you look inside of her eye
It’s obvious this time you havin the time of your life
The timin is right, this kind of a night need two at a time
'Round 2 o'clock I find these hoes just losin their mind
Girls gone wild, going all out
Let’s be honest, you ain’t gotta lie
One question, how many freaks do it take til this bitch turn into a orgy
3 shots in and I’m feelin like Horry
Shoulda never gave a nigga money, man pour me
Just pour me up, higher, I’m sippin lean like I’m on a fuckin diet
LA nigga, bout to start a fuckin riot
Why you tryna deny it?

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I could tell by the way you’ve been lookin' at yo girlfriend
I could tell by the way you’ve been dancing wit' yo girlfriend
Can I ask iz u down? Iz u down? (uhh, uhh)
Iz u down? Iz u down?

Hell & Back (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly & Kid Ink]
Walk a mile in my Chucks, see where you end up
You can tell 'em that
I've been through hell and back

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back
[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, let’s burn it down, underrated
Could never say I was underground
Maybe a little misunderstood when I’m just riding round
In all lanes, like OJ
Doing big things, no small change
We ain’t going nowhere like wine stains
You see me with the arsenal
Welcome to the arson show
Alumni, lace up, don’t trip, I got it, bro
Sold out in my city, overseas in your state
Wore double X-L white T’s as a freshman
To the XXL 2012 freshman
Damn, I rose up, in the front like Rosa
It’s been a roller coaster, now I’m ridin' in a Rover
See the camera’s out, but you gotta stay focused
They expose us, but it’s still so much
I swear that y'all don’t no-tice man
You could tell 'em that I’ve been through hell and back
But I’m home, yeah, took a long time getting here
But I’m finally in my zone
So gone off that loud you can hear in my tone
Put your lighters in the air
Let’s start a firestorm

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
As we bow our heads
Amen, praise God for everyone
That made it out of dark like caveman
And is this my moment? Shit, cause I’ve been waiting
Came in the game the least favorite
Made it through rain, now it’s haling
I’m just saying
Hell and back ain’t no trip for me
Please Satan don’t hold me back
God said this ain’t it for me
But these haters done got me trapped
(I swear to God y'all can't see me, motherfucker)
Shit and it’s these haters that got me strapped
Paranoid 'bout my friends cause these favors done got me jack
Consequence of all the misdemeanors
That I was willing to do to get some rougher ends
Until the cops (Woop, woop)
Then I’d hop the fence and steal me an old school like Das EFX
Another call collect and it's sad cause
Those are friends that you grew with
Telling me they knew that I’d make it
Now you got the chance to go prove it, gone
Pay stubs, cold cash
Work this and I sold that
Wrote this in my note pad and spilled more ink than my whole tat
Spill blood on that stage, uh
I’m the truth and they know that
Critics lie but these numbers don’t
Say hello to this gold plaque, it’s Kells
[Chorus: Kid Ink]
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back
You can tell 'em that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back10Embed

I Just Want it All Lyrics[Chorus]
I just want it all, money and the cars right
I don't wear a tie but they say I live a boss life
I just want it all, pullin' a bad bitch, way back then
Thought that we would never have this
Now I just want it all, all, all, all, all, all, yeah
I just want it all, all, all, all, all, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I just want it all, high above the law
Kill 'em so cool you can call me Mr. Frost
Come and find me where the money is, ever feeling lost?
I just wanna ball, so sick of playing toss
I remember back then I had a dream since then
I've been sleep walking all-all-all the ups and downs I was sea-sawing
Only made me strong like steroids
Game time I just served these niggas like a bell boy
Tell them that it's over , finito
I can make it bump bump bump like a mosquito
It's just all in my estilo
And my pockets are the only thing bigger than my ego
[Chorus]
I just want it all, money and the cars right
I don't wear a tie but they say I live a boss life
I just want it all, pullin' a bad bitch, way back then
Thought that we would never have this
Now I just want it all, all, all, all, all, all, yeah
I just want it all, all, all, all, all, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna stall, I would never leave means
I don't wanna fall, no matter the cost (tell 'em)
I'm all in till the coffin
Kush coughin nicer than your conscience
Finally everywhere you wanna be moving high velocity
Driving irresponsibly but I think you should come
And take a ride see the world through my eyes
Every day is a surprise
So I party like my birthday, LA is my birthplace
First place, west side, loud as a I wanna be
There's sleeping on me, now they are in the fetal
Yeah I'm neato everything's in tuxedo

[Chorus]
I just want it all, money and the cars right
I don't wear a tie but they say I live a boss life
I just want it all, pullin' a bad bitch, way back then
Thought that we would never have this
Now I just want it all, all, all, all, all, all, yeah
I just want it all, all, all, all, all, yeah yeah

No Option Lyrics[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I take a look around ain’t nothing brand new
But the brand A clothes and a couple tattoos
City going nuts like a fucking cashew
I’m the man in my city, don’t get it confused
LA every day, west side, deuce deuce, neighborhood su-woo
What side do you choose?
Green in my eyes, red fire in my lungs
These diamonds blue don’t hold your tongue
You can suck this dick, got an issue hit her
Shots fired, pistol spitta
Before your name, do you remember?
It's what it’s gonna say when I'm through with you nigga
I don’t hold no grudge, just hold my nuts
Made it the game, put a hole in ya tux
Oohhh kill em, ho don't fuck!
All she say, nigga ho don't fuck
Middle fingers stuck to the world on edge
Might jump but a nigga can’t feel my legs
I’m high on the moon tryna plant my flag
For the team got a dream but I ain't slept yet
All you niggas robots, got a fat ass blunt I'ma role model
I don’t need no co-op, goin for the win it’s no option
[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yup, its no option, Yup, its no option
Yup, look around its no option
Yup, tell me what you know bout it

[Verse 2: King Los]
Light work, this a free throw doe
I blow strong, nigga strong arm Debo doe
I got the Ice Tea Range and the V cocoa
I say, Ice-T TV and Coco
That’s coco like cocaine nigga be snow though
Drop the ice in the pot and whip three more doe
Know a chick named Shaneneh that move a lot of yay yay
That say a girlfriend get the kilo low
I might have dropped outta college, but I mastered cash
I get the old school scratch grand master flash
You looking like Chris Cross with a bag of hash
Because you must be high with you backwards ass, ballin’
Niggas work at Walmart, where they play at
Turn em into a Target when I show then where the K at
Sajak, I’m wheelin’ in the fortune, lay back
Rain like April, but I might bring may back, or my back
Cause my neck and my back aching
My mack and my tech for my slab of bacon
The bacon, they hate I made it, I make 'em take it
I innovated, I made em state it when they debate it
I’m checking niggas my nigga who play make it take it
They just faking, I take it say they I wouldn’t make it
Damn Ink, what these niggas ain’t learned it before
I make home look good like the furniture store, King!
[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yup, its no option, Yup, its no option
Yup, look around its no option
Yup, tell me what you know bout it

[Verse 3: King Los]
I'm about a hundred is a hundred could be
Cause my whole motherfucking ghetto coming with me
I’m a king so my thousand dollar sneakers on the gas of the phantom
Means there's rose petals under my feet
Yes Lord, yes Lord, get stepped on nigga, step off
Cause asking if there's a nigga better than me
That's just gon get you crickets, you might as well buy a pet frog
Hold up, I said look you whylin’, rookie stop it
If we was in school I woulda shook ya pocket
Took your wallet, your girl say the dick game money
She just want me to hold the pussy hostage
I drop the top down, look it's ostrich
My links is juicy like I'm cooking sausage
I threw the wheels on, lift the ass up
Look like I got the Chevy pussy poppin, King!

[Verse 4: Kid Ink]
Sitting leaning back and my seat feel fifteen feet high over ya reach, roll up
Downtown nigga hood gonna speed check your IG, that OG
Before for my name is stuffed inside of a swisher
Switching lane no sign of slipping
Killing the strip no sign of a siren
Sipping straight, stop chasing my high man
I can’t lose nigga too unlikely
Ain’t no tie when I lace my Nike's
Nightly money sleep on the nightstand next to the bible
Holy, amen, I am more than a man and a monster
Me and the mafia fuck your squadron
Kid Ink, King Los, they don't want problems
But you leave us no option
[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yup, its no option, Yup, its no option
Yup, look around its no option
Yup, tell me what you know bout it59Embed
