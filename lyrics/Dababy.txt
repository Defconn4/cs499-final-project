ROCKSTAR Lyrics[Intro: DaBaby]
Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, SethInTheKitchen)

[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
[Verse 1: DaBaby]
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay," don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: DaBaby & Roddy Ricch]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop171Embed

INTRO Lyrics[Verse 1]
Thinkin' 'bout my grandmama and shit (Wait a minute, who are you?)
I got the number one record, they acknowledged the jit (Ayy, yo, Kid)
They goin' crazy when they play it, head bobbin' and shit
And I'm just somewhere fucked up thinkin' 'bout my father and shit
They found him dead a couple days before I started tour
Same day I flew back to the city from Miami
I was out there with the family
Just lookin' at my daughter
Thinkin' to myself like, "Damn, my baby look just like my daddy"
Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that's fucked up
That shit there was confusin', a lil' bit, you know I flew in with the stick
Okay, like let me know what's up before I lose it in this bitch
And everybody tryna talk, I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna click
I'm tryna send somebody wit' him
Somebody let me know what's happenin'
My last name K-I-R-K, Kirk
You know how I rock behind my daddy
You know I never gave a fuck about the world, just about my family
How the fuck I make it to the top same day I lost the nigga that had me?
How a nigga perform on BET and a year ago couldn't afford a sandwich?
I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali
What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'
I got some questions, I'm a die about respect if I don't get answers
My mama stood up in that chair, took it like a G when she had cancer
My brother be thinkin' that we don't love him and let him struggle like we ain't family
Like I won't give up all I got to see you happy, nigga
We shocked the world, everybody know what's happenin', nigga
I'm still Lil' Jon Jon, my song, it just went platinum, nigga
We on our own time, let's go move out to Cali, nigga
Put the kids in homeschool, let's go get us a mansion, nigga
Let's raise our kids right, let's watch the shit we teach 'em, nigga
Let's start a business for you so they can't say that you leechin', nigga
How I know I'm the chosen one, 'cause sometimes when I be speakin', nigga
Like on this song, I ain't rappin', I'm preachin', nigga
[Chorus]
If I love you, then I need ya (Let's go)
I fuck with you like Martin fuck with Gina (Uh)
We family like we Venus and Serena (Hey)
Let's go get married like we Thankgod and Kenisha (Okay)
Don't give a fuck about the world, just 'bout my people (Facts)
I don't care what the fuck they told you, we ain't equal (Uh-uh)
Niggas ain't cut from the same cloth, these niggas see-through (Ayy)
And I be too busy doin' me to see what he do, nigga

[Verse 2]
Yeah, verse two, that lil' nigga from the other side (Uh-huh)
And I do it myself, whenever I ride, you know that my brothers ride (Okay)
And I still got a lotta shit on my mind that I can't undecide (Yeah, yeah)
Got me ready to slide, feelin' like Doughboy when his brother died (Boyz n the Hood)
You know how I step, you know how I rep, you know about Baby, nigga (You know about Baby)
You know how I'm comin' back for that cross if you ever play me, nigga (Get back)
You know how I got it up out the mud and turned it to gravy, nigga (Huh)
And hit the rap game like crack cocaine in the '80s, nigga

[Interlude]
Fuck you niggas talkin' 'bout, bruh? Like.. (Oh my God, oh)

TOES Lyrics[Chorus: DaBaby]
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights (Boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine (Alright)
What I look like with all them twenties? (Huh?)
Know them hoes like how I'm coming (Yeah)
What I look like with all this money? (Huh?)
How I look havin' all these hoes? (Uh)
When I crack a smile, white gold (Bling)
Yeah, I'm talkin' diamonds, froze (Yeah)
Came from the bottom, toes (Woah, Kenny)
[Verse 1: DaBaby]
Yeah, backend Baby (A hundred)
That's what they pay me a show (Let's go)
That's probably some cap in my rap
By the time this shit drop, they gon' pay me some more (Uh-huh)
And I still can go back to the trap
Send a box, pick it up, make a play at the store
Feelings still hurt from when I saved that ho

[Chorus: DaBaby]
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)

Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine (Alright)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Nope
Too raw, dope (Yeah)
You know I'm one of the G.O.A.T.'s
She let me put it in the back of her throat
Walk in the bank with a M in a tote (Yeah)
I'm tryna make a deposit
Let 'em try play with the money (Pow, pow)
Shawty gon' take off your noggin
Long as she want it and pick it, I'm buyin' it
I had the Rover for a year, I don't drive
I get 'em whacked, I don't advise 'em to try it, yeah
I'm runnin' shit, I ain't lyin'
I got a backend for one twenty-five
I bought a Patek for one eighty-five
This shit gettin' easy at this point
[Chorus: DaBaby]
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife

Say you got that sack, I got that sack

Heartless, don't need a valentine (Forever)
I call 'em racks, not bands (Why?)
Ain't no rubber band on mine (At all)
I used to be down, down, down, down
Waiting on taxes time (Fucked up)
Look at me now, now, now, now
They pay me to flex and shine (I'm up, let's get it)
Big speaker like an eighteen inch sub (Yeah)
I'm a hundred, you a dub (Nothin')
Lookin' for me, I'm booked up (Where you at?)

Diamonds on my earlobe, ice on dyke (Huh?)
One-fifty on studs

Next Song Lyrics[Verse]
When I talk it, I live it, they feel it (Hah)
And I got a pretty bitch with a fat ass
Put one leg in the air when I hit it (Ha-ha-ha-ha, Firzt on the track)
The police behind me, you know that I'm smashing
I ain't pulling over, you tripping (Vroom, vroom)
But I ain't tryna talk about police
Let's talk 'bout bitches, let's talk 'bout business (Okay)
Let's talk 'bout this young nigga that came up from nothing
Now he worth a motherfuckin' million (M)
Used to pay for a section, now they gotta bring us the backend to come in the building (Hah)
I knew that I was special back when we was breaking in houses and robbin' and stealin' (Okay)
We made you put your hands in the air, put that thang in your face, run your pockets, we dippin' (Hah)
And I ain't gotta act like I'm 'bout it, ain't ask for no vouchers, I'm really official (Okay)
Tryna look out for karma, I had good intentions, I'm still asking God to forgive me (Turn up)
I know I got these fuck niggas pissed off, I'm over they bitch house, I'm all on the WiFi
I'ma trick 'em and play Mr. Nice Guy (Hah)
When he front, I run off, nigga, bye-bye
I tell her I'm a motherfuckin' star
She can see me on TV, just turn it on Syfy
You know that I got a whole lot of hoes, and they all different colors, I mix 'em like tie-dye (Yeah)
We gon' make your ho dance with the devil, it's October 7th, shout out my boy DaDa (Ha)
Turn it up on a whole 'nother level, now they can't deny it, I'm catching they eye now (They eye)
You might not wanna run up on me to promote your CD 'less you ready to die now (Boom)
I can lower the price on the P's and you get 'em from me if you buy more than five now, bitch
[Outro]
And I'm the best motherfuckin' rapper, man, you know like
Th-that's just too much for 'em, like
You know it's just too much for 'em, First
You see what I'm saying, it's just too much for 'em, man
You know, it's too much for 'em
Blank Blank, you know
The best motherfuckin' rapper
The prettiest chocolate nigga alive

Beatbox Freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
Best motherfuckin' rapper, nigga
This Baby, nigga, let's go

[Verse]
Ready to get it started, nigga (Go)
Whenever you want it
I was the man with the plan since a shawty
Pull up to the Grammy Awards with my .40 (Damn E, this shit exclusive)
She told me she like how I'm dressin' and I ain't eatin' no salad (Uh-huh)
Stevie Wonder can see that I'm havin'
I told her, "Be patient," she waited
I gave her the dick, she walked out doin' the "Beat Box Challenge"
Like yeah, get in thеre, baby (Get in therе)
You know me, hit you anywhere, baby (Let's go)
Know she gon' do whatever I say
I could piss in a cup, call it lemonade, baby
Let that bitch off, I'm a renegade, baby
I'ma get outta there, I ain't feelin' that (Huh?)
Nigga run up on me with a cellphone out
He gon' fuck around, die on the internet (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Fuck it, kill him on IG Live
Let the whole world see the nigga die (Die)
Yeah, shout-out to SpotEm', we got 'em (Get down)
Even though he a rapper, he shot him
I get this big pretty-ass smile from my mama (Cheese)
Get this motherfuckin' voice from my daddy
I learned how to pimp on them hoes from my uncle (Pimp, pimp)
Let her suck on my toes 'cause I'm nasty (Okay)
Like fuck it, she asked me to do it
Play with me, I'ma actually shoot you
Most of these niggas be cap and we knew it
These niggas drop shit and we laugh at they music
I know how to murder these niggas with kindness
Fuckin' they bitch from the back, how I do it
I buy a Cuban and fill it with diamonds
Send my assistant to pick up some condoms
Instagram model at the hotel textin' me now
Want me to give her the Johnson
Damn, that nigga Baby on fire and it won't go out
They know that lil' nigga's a problem
Got a big .45 on decock (Go)
Usin' big words like I'm T.I. (Turn up)
Don't wanna get me started, nigga
Turn me up, niggas gon' see why
Nigga, you a bitch, JoJo Siwa (Bitch)
You let the wrong nigga get rich
Both of these chains on my neck, they compete with each other
They fightin' and throwin' a fit
Know how these hoes like to argue and beef with each other
She fightin' now, over the dick
You should already know you ain't searchin' DaBaby
'Cause that nigga like to come in with the stick
I don't like to get into the mix (No)
I done got paid in full, my nigga
I get them hoes like I'm Mitch
Even got white people all on my dick (Go)
Yeah, second year, six-time Grammy-nominated
Came through turnt up, everybody hated
Before I had my first M, it was Billion Dollar Baby
He bet the house and his self like Las Vegas (Go)
You want the shit? Gotta earn it
He off the leash, he don't think he can get murdered
Know how to swim, so I fuck with who fuckin' with me
I take a bridge and I burn it
Let me see if you can swim, lil' nigga
Shit gettin' out of hand, I just parked a new Benz
Hopped in a new Benz, lil' nigga (Let's go)
And Ion't want new friends
[Outro]
(That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby)
Yeah, yeah, they say they want that old shit back, you know (Said that, make that, stand on that)
I told 'em, don't get me started, nigga
They say they want that Baby Jesus, put me in that mode (Yeah, get that Baby Jesus)
You know, I'm tryna enjoy this bread (Go)
You know, be fancy and shit, be mainstream and shit, you know, you know? (Fasho)
They said I went commercial, like I still won't come up off the hip and hurt you
Bitch ass nigga
Aight, man, it's 6:55 in the mornin', man, shit21Embed

ROCKSTAR (BLM Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: DaBaby]
Even if I told you, still wouldn't understand what happened
Rather be myself, if people look at me, don't matter
A rockstar, nigga, just tryna keep it kosher
Try to keep my eyes on my own paper like my teachers told me
Soon as niggas think it's over (Poof)
Number one on the charts, I'm there vicariously
Oh, there they go
Biasedly pushin' negative narratives, I'm ready, though
Cops wanna pull me over, embarrass me
Abusin' power, you never knew me, thought I was arrogant
As a juvenile, police pulled their guns like they scared of me
And we're used to how crackers treat us, now that's the scary thing
Want anything we good at and we cherish it
Now we all fed up and niggas comin' back for everything
Rockstars, nigga, just watch the news, they burnin' cop cars, nigga
Kill another nigga, break the law, then call us outlaws, nigga
What happened? Want us to keep it peaceful
Shoulda seen them hatin' bitches face when I bought that Lamborghini (SethInTheKitchen)
Throw up my middle finger, police can't catch me, this a
[Chorus: DaBaby]
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay," don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: DaBaby & Roddy Ricch]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Roddy Ricch]
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop16Embed

FIND MY WAY Lyrics[Intro]
Wait a minute, who are you? (Ayy, yo, K.i.D)

[Chorus]
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga
I fuck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I know the feelin', ain't it? (Okay)
You ever feel the way I feel, you know it feel amazin' (Let's go)
I had this bitch, we used to kick it, she was feelin' Baby (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
She stepped on my heart, had me feelin' basic (Damn)
You know how people like to come back when you level up (Uh-huh)
I made a change, you stayed the same, I got ahead of ya
Plus I been tryin' to free some time up in my schedule, but (Uh-huh)
When opportunity knockin', I never say no
'Cause I been busy catchin' them blessings I used to pray for (Let's go)
Stackin' up the backend like Tetris, we playin' Legos
And every day I pray to God that a nigga don't try to play, though
'Cause I don't like to play, be done gave a nigga a halo (Boom, boom, boom)
Thinkin' 'bout the people I lost, know I got some angels
Chillin' with my freak, when we fuckin', it ease my anger
I'm takin' selfies with my bitch, she keep switchin' up different angles
And no, I never kept a bitch, but I always keep me a banger (Boom, boom, boom)
[Chorus]
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga (Ah)
I fuck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings

Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I let her ride again
She spread her legs and open up, I end up slidin' in (Okay)
She know the shit excitin' you is not excitin' him (Me)
She swallow me up every mornin' like a vitamin (Yup)
He know to come look where I'm at, he wanna find her, shit (She with me)
Know I'm aggressive, when she kiss me, like to bite her lip (Grr)
I don't be makin' love songs, they don't excite a jit (No)
Real nigga, I got feelings, I'm not hiding it (Yeah, okay, let's go)
Still pimpin', tell the bitch I really like her friend (Yeah, bitch)
You know her pussy good 'cause I be tryna fly her in (Yeah, bitch)
If I speak once, she don't respond, I won't say hi again (Bitch)
She catch me once and let me slide, I never lie again (Let's go)
My name not Melly, I got murder on my mind again (Uh-huh)
I'm with the shits, I'd kill him twice if he could die again
And if he think 'bout tryin' me, he better try again
'Cause I'ma let 'em spin, if he don't drop, then we gon' slide again (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
[Chorus]
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga (Ah)
I fuck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song (Bitch)32Embed

Oh, they wanna check on me now (Huh), you don't really love me admit it (Bitch)
I'm with a bitch from the west side of town, I like my hoes ghetto and pretty
I got that iron and I pull it out now, you ain't the only one with it (Boom)
I'm tryna go get the cake for my daughter like it's her birthday, can you dig it? (Can you dig it)
They tell me they like how I do my lil' dance, I can't really dance, I be jiggin' (For real)
And I'm 'bout to hop on a flight out to Cali, free Doshman, they got him in prison (Free)
I gotta go sit down and meet with a label, they better be talkin' some millions (Millions)
And if not, I'll go check on the price of the pounds, blow it down and fly back to the city
Like fuck it, let's get back to work (Okay)
Blow a kiss at a bitch, I'm a flirt (Mwah)
Nigga play with my people, I gotta get even
He might as well pick out a shirt (Yeah)

They know I'm a dog and I'm off the leash
I flick off a bitch like a flea (Rrr)
You gotta get out of here, Jack (Get out)
See a broke ho and act like I'm blind (What you do?)
Georgia, Georgia, I cannot give you a dime
It ain't like Atlanta, I came out of Charlotte, you know that shit took me some time (Okay)
And I hold up the family, you wanna be me then you better go get on your grind (Yeah)
What you gon' say at the Grammy's?
Shout out to God and my daughter and shout out my mom
And oh, yeah...
[Chorus]
Bitch, it's DaBaby, what you heard about me? (What you heard?)
I put that nigga up, now niggas actin' nervous 'round me (Up)
I'm in the rental truck sticked up like Walker Texas Ranger (I got the sticks)
I'm on my grind like fuck a bitch, I'll get some pussy later

[Verse 2]
This pussy bitch done tried to bring the pussy to the table
Can't even get shit in your name, can't even get no cable (What the fuck?)
I was at the bottom when it rained, I held it down, no anchor (Yeah, yeah)
She did me wrong, sucked my dick and treat me like a stranger (Goddamn)
Ain't gotta get love from no bitch, I get love from my baby
If your boyfriend anything like daddy, nigga gettin' strangled (Play with my baby, nigga)

[Chorus]
Bitch, it's DaBaby, what you heard about me? (What you heard?)

[Outro]
Like, like I don't want no pussy (I don't want that)
No, no, I don't want it, no (No)

I'll let you suck my dick though if that's what you—if you cool with that
You fuckin' with that?
That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby5Embed

Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say

As soon as she done with that nappy ass hair, you can call up your boy to come pick up his bitch (Brrt, damn)
Look at my wrist, that's a brick, I just fucked up my Rolex, but fuck it, it's lit (Damn)

I just went sat with the label (Huh?)
Niggas offered me a contract (What happened?)
Told them niggas, "I ain't want it" (Why?)
The shit was wack, I didn't sign that (Uh)
I'm the best, but never mind that (Okay)
My shit so hard that they rewind that (Ah)
Got that work if you can't find that (Huh?)
You can't afford it, we can finance
I got one foot in the trap, got one foot up they ass, ditch your coat on the rap
Got my dick in your bitch, she be bendin' it over and bustin' it open and throwin' it back
I'm tryna go fuck her buddy
Fuck all these hoes, 'cause they don't really love me
I'm tryna get me some motherfuckin' money
If they free Meek Mill, why they ain't free my cousin?
I bet we shoot up your motherfuckin' party if somebody touch me or one of my brothers
I bet won't none of these niggas that talk on the internet try me, they see me in public
I bet they play all my motherfuckin' teachin'
Bitch, I don't rap, I be motherfuckin' preachin'
I bet you paid for that motherfuckin' show and I bet you paid for that motherfuckin' feature (Bitch)
[Chorus]
I'm on they ass today, I just went and picked me up a bag today

NASTY Lyrics[Verse 1: DaBaby]
She know I'm nasty (Yeah)
She like when I pull it out and I put it all over her ass cheeks (Like, uh, ooh)
And she don't gotta ask me (C'mon)
Yeah, I want head before we fuck and I want it nasty
She like when I tell her to spit on it (Like, psh)
I get that mouth and I sit on the couch and I make her sit on it (Let's go)
Yeah, I was that lil' nigga that could take a bitch from his big homie
Especially if she flexible, I flex her
I take both her legs and I put 'em behind her head like she a pretzel
Then I pick her up and I slam her down on her head like I'm a wrestler
Like mm, tryna kill the pussy, call the ambulance, get a stretcher
I be fucking his bitch while he ain't at home
And she got them pics of me in her phone
Know that man a fool if he don't leave
'Cause bitch can't leave a nigga alone, she call me
[Chorus: Ashanti & Megan Thee Stallion]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
We got London On Da Track
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Ooh, the shit will never feel the same, yeah (Ahh)

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Quit talking that shit, when I drop that pin, come drop that dick (Come drop that dick)
He deep in them covers, this pussy like butter, he put it in, damn near nutted (Yeah)
He know he made it, he fuckin' on Megan, it's driving his last ho crazy
I like to talk shit when I fuck, I need a rough nigga like DaBaby (Haa, haa, haa, haa)
When he hit the city, he gon' tap in, he gon' fly me out to put it back in
And I ain't trippin' when a nigga pull my hair, 'cause he gon' pay for it to put it back in
I put one leg on the headboard and leave the other leg on the mattress
Look down at him while he smackin', get them headshots like an actress (Haa)

[Verse 3: DaBaby]
Yeah, my baby like to act up when we fuckin' (Uh-huh)
Aggressive freak, she tell me to smack her when we fuckin'
I started to laugh, she said "What's funny?"
She throwing that ass, she said "Quit running"
I'm holding it back, 'cause I don't wanna nut quick, but fuck it
Really got nothing to hide, she know what I'm what's up with
Me, we started at 12:30 and fucking 'til three
It's hot, I'm sweating out bullets on her, I need something to drink
Feel like a workout, don't it? (Uh-huh)
I'm doing my push-ups in that pussy
We getting our work out on it (Mm-mm)
I put a bath towel on the bed, just so she can squirt all on it
Like fwoosh, told you to stretch, now it hurt, now don't it? (Uh-huh)
She said, "Fuck if it hurts, I want it", I'm on it
She like when I take a pill and take her under (Let's go)
I fucked that bitch so good, she prolly ain't even save ya number (Yeah)
Like "Boom, boom, boom", lay the thunder
Mm, mm, say she wanna be my baby mama
Girl, you on the right track, yeah
I put it in her face, she say she like that, yeah (Brr), she call me
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Ooh, he comin' when I say his name, yeah

[Bridge: Ashanti]
Sometimes I just want you to slide right in (Slide right in)
Pick me up and put these thighs around your neck (Thighs around your neck)
He mesmerized, tattoed his mind, he won't forget
DaBaby tryna have a threesome with 'Shanti and Megan, ayy

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, oh

OFF THE RIP Lyrics[Intro]
Straight off the rip, you know I don't wait for the drop (Off the rip)
I go out to eat with my kids and my mama, you know I ain't datin' no thot (Okay, let's go)
Believe what you see, nigga
I can't name a rapper that's out here and breathin' that's fuckin' with me, nigga (Uh, uh)
I'm takin' they hoes, Forces, Adidas pants and a tee, nigga (What the fuck?)
They like how? That don't even match
Okay, hold on, take my phone, baby
Let's go

[Verse]
I'm just a lil' nigga from Charlotte, the biggest new artist (The four)
They wanna see me up the road, but my lawyer a fool with dismissin' the charges (Hah)
You know BDB ENT, we gon' pull up Infinitis, Challengers, Chargers (Okay)
And no, we don't gotta get money with you, bitch, we gon' get money regardless (Huh)
I'ma let you do all of the talkin'
Don't get me started, you know I'ma stop it (Go 'head and talk)
And I don't got a cent for a ho
She bringin' up money, I'm changin' the topic (Huh, huh)
She need to be talkin' 'bout suckin' some dick
I nut in her mouth and she gargle (Ew, ew)
If she spit out that rich nigga shit without swallowin', me and her havin' some problems (Bitch)
We havin' revolvers strictly for murder and plenty of pistols and choppers (Clack, clack)
Ayy, when you gon' stop?
Whenever the fat lady sing, I don't listen to opera (Ooh, ooh)
You know how I give it up
Fuck around, fucked up my hand, beat a nigga up
Pull off on a nigga like vroom
He don't got a car, he still catchin' the city bus (Hah)
His baby mama unemployed
So she in the club with her ass and her titties out (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
And we done robbed so many plugs
You better check and go ask what my city 'bout
Had to slide the nigga bitch a dub
Wanted to fuck me but I only hit her mouth (No cap)
Take the palm of my hand, slap me a nigga
Got somethin' to say, make 'em spit it out
You knowin' 'bout Baby
All the shit that nigga rappin' 'bout, that nigga really 'bout
And no, I ain't takin' advice from a nigga
I'm cool on that, I got it figured out
These niggas be cryin' 'bout petty shit
I can't relate because I took a bigger loss
And these niggas know I been a boss
Ever since Rick Ross was the biggest boss (Yeah, yeah)
Got diamonds all over my teeth
I been eatin' chicken, I need me some dental floss
Hold my watch in the air
It's no longer hot, you can go turn the condition off
I'm hittin' this ho on the low
She fuck with me hard, she say that her nigga soft (Huh)
Why you talkin' so low?
'Cause if a nigga find out and he try me, I'm knockin' a nigga off
I'm ridin' past 12, flyin' through fast as hell, flickin' a nigga off (Vroom, vroom)
I'm revin' the gas, burnin' out on niggas' ass, I'm showin' my engine off (Hah)
[Interlude]
Hahaha
And that's just how the fuck I get down, man, you know I just be playin' sometimes
Like right now, like, I'm just fuckin' 'round, you know
Me and kid, you know, we up in the penthouse, you know, kickin' shit
And, uh, I'm still the best rapper

[Outro]
Straight off the rip, you know I don't wait for the drop (Off the rip)
I go out to eat with my kids and my mama, you know I ain't datin' no thot (Okay, let's go)
Believe what you see, nigga
I can't name a rapper that's out here and breathin' that's fuckin' with me, nigga7Embed

XXL Lyrics[Intro]
I got 20 on my beat

[Verse]
Everybody know my name ringin' bells
Ringin' bells like the hallway (Uh-huh)
I ain't gotta cap in no mothafuckin' rap
I'll whip out and air it out broad day (Mmm)
I got in with that stick, and I'm with that
Break a nigga in half like a Kit-Kat (Uh-huh)
I been tryna be positive, mama (Uh-huh)
They ain't fuckin' wit' Jonathan, mama (Nope)
Who you know put they mothafuckin' self on the map
And now they don't owe nobody shit? (Me)
I send one of my lil' niggas, come take you off
You get laid on the floor by a jit (Ha)
Got pulled over with fifty-five K in my pocket (Woo)
The police, they know I'm legit (Woo, woo)
The police, they know I got sticks
They be worried about me, they know I'm a clique
These niggas, they know I'm a dawg
I ain't worried about him, I know he a bitch (Meow)
The next nigga that come play with me
I'ma send him to go ask 2Pac for a pic, bitch
They say I'm the hottest new nigga
Go check the thermometer, that nigga sick (Hot)
Nigga must have a fever or somethin'
Heard he was born up in Cleveland or somethin' (Uh-huh)
Let me give you a history lesson
We moved back to Charlotte, 1999 (Okay)
I ain't sayin that none of that matter
'Cause if somebody touch me, then somebody dyin' (No cap)
Why he talkin' so calm when he say that? (Huh?)
How he make 'em rewind and replay that? (Yeah)
Who you know get a fade once a week and they tryna get waves?
Fuck a mothafuckin' wave-cap (Uh-huh)
Every time that the DJ play "Suge"
Niggas throw up they arms like a mothafuckin' racetrack (Let's go)
Every time that my baby girl see me
She run and say "Daddy", I love when she say that (Mwah)
Every time I hit one of my moves
All the bitches go crazy, they like how I do that (Let's go)
I keep one in the head, if I don't let off first
I'ma dive to the side when I shoot back
Yeah, I'm comin' like Blade in this bitch (Ah)
Fuck around, and walked out in a trench coat
They gon' have to put me with the greats (Uh-huh)
Wanna fuck with me, she gotta wait (Bitch)
On the yacht, with me, me and the kids
There's four of us, we on the sea eatin' steak (Yep)
I won't go back and forth with a shrimp
You goin out sad 'bout a ho, I'm a pimp (Ha)
He keep bumpin' his motherfuckin' gums
We gon put his ass up like a mothafuckin' blimp (Bitch)
Like to talk on the pillow wit' hoes, that's gon' get him exposed
He a mothafuckin' simp (Hold up)
You know he got that thang on him, baby
Quit askin' him why that boy walk with a limp (Shh, shh, shh)
I don't care bout this mothafuckin' chain (Uh-huh)
But I'll still bust your mothafuckin' brain (Uh-huh)
Just got head on a mothafuckin' plane (No cap)
Ain't no cap in my rap, I'm the truth (Ha)
End up fuckin' this ho from the back
I knew her for a day, she on go, she the swoop (Yeah, yeah, yeah, swoop)
And these niggas ain't livin' like that
Why he talkin' so gangsta? Your bro, he a fluke (Fluke, fluke)
They know Baby gon' blow, he a flute (Flute)
They know Baby gon' blow, he the bomb (Boom)
They know Baby was just in Miami
Now he in L.A., nigga think he LeBron (Ha)
They know Baby go baby on baby (Uh-huh)
But five years ago, nigga say he was John (Keep goin')
I touch down at the front of the plane
And the driver come pick up my Louis Vuitton (Them facts)
While he drive me around, I be blowin' out pressure
I'm chillin' backseat with the iron (Bitch)
[Outro]
And I'm done with this shit, man
I'm one of the best mothafuckin' rappers, man (I'm fuckin' done with this shit, man)
You know (I'm done with this)
But I ain't gon' keep, you know, I mean, braggin' 'bout this
I'm done with this one, I'm the best mothafuckin' rapper, man
Quit playin' with Baby, man, do not play with me
I'm just exercising, I'm just exercising my craft, that's it (I'm the best mothafuckin' rapper)
And I'm not gonna keep sayin' this shit, (Yeah) I'm done sayin' this shit
Uh
And I got 20 on my mothafuckin' beat, but this nigga can't engineer for shit
I'm 'bout to make this nigga just start makin' beats and quit engineering

You saving hoes, we need to make a movie 'bout you
Wear your mothafuckin' cape (Ha, ha)
I tell your ho, "We'll make a movie"
But we're probably never goin' on a date (Ayy, ah)
I'm motivated by the money, money motivate me
I always got my mind on it (Mind)
I went to jail because I tried to catch a flight
And I forgot I had the iron on me (Yeah)
I get the shit so cheap you think I drop a ticket
But really threw a extra five on it (Five)
And everything a nigga drop be going crazy
Sounding like I took my time on it
Threw a bag on the table, he thought it was ten pounds
But I really put nine on it (Ah)
And half of them bitches was fake weed
When he open them up he gon' hate me (Ha)
I don't gotta rape bitches, they rape me
Beat a rap nigga up like I'm AP
Throw that rock in the air like I'm Jay-Z
Got a Glock on me, now, and I still'll do it
You can't name five niggas in the rap game
That can come out with realer music
Standing on anything that I ever said all alone
And I still approve it
You know I shot your homeboy
Fucked your main bitch, robbed your partner, I did that
And still get ya stepped on
The most slept on in the game, don't forget that, bitch
[Chorus]
I ain't trippin' off another nigga, I'll be straight
(Tell these niggas to quit fuckin' playin' with me)
Ain't even got a chance to eat

I seen you lookin' at my plate
(And I'm the muhfuckin' prettiest chocolate nigga alive)
You know the bitches treat me great
(What the fuck they gon do with me, huh?)
They suck my dick and feed me grapes
I'm on my way to get a bag
(What the fuck they gon do with me?)
I'm fuckin' up, I'm runnin' late (Hey, ah)

[Verse 2]
I just told my bitch that she gotta learn
To be nice to my side bitch
You gotta quit trippin' and callin' me private (Hey)
'Cause all of my other lil' bitches don't like it (Brrt)
You know I'm a dog, babe, you know that I'm trifling
Been like this forever and you know you used to like it
That boom on my side and ya I call it my sidekick (Boom)
I whip out and shoot it, just do it like Nike
I pull out and swing that bitch ride on the crowd
Like a ceiling fan (Yeah)
Yeah, we took the pounds from the middle man (Yeah)
I got plenty of haters, got plenty fans (Yeah)
But a hater gon' hate, we don't give a damn (Ahh)
Got my bitch making oodles o' noodles (Hah)
Pulled up with that tool in an Uber (Hah, Hah)
I'm in the pool with a cougar (Yeah)
They only cool on computers (Turn up)
They told me I look better in real life (Okay)
I don't care what a fuck nigga feel like (Yeah)
