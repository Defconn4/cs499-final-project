GENOCIDE Lyrics[Part I]
[Intro]
Bitch, I'm smokin' gas in my chambers like it's the *********
We're sorry, your lyric could not be completed because—
Ayy, you Lil Darkie, nigga?
And we want to suppress your opinion fascistically
Take away the first amendment
All hail censorship, all hail our feelings

[Verse 1]
My God is realer than yours, He says what I do is right
That I should fight if Heaven pours
I am very, very, sorry, my apologies, for comin' off so harshly
Impart me, second chance, so I can dance the way you want me
You Nazi, got me, take a lot more than that to top me
Soft ain't what I'm made of, you're the one actin' like Adolf
Cocky, way that you goose-steppin', way that you loose-lippin'
Talkin' 'bout who trippin', talkin' 'bout who to shove under the bus
And who all of us trust that we shouldn't
This just in, Lil Darkie is racist, spreadin' the message of Satan with faces
Blacker than any of us prolly are, but I'm still offended 'cause I'm a retard
He tryna be hard, we tryna be safe by makin' it hard for you to create
Niggas that heard of me fight and debate
I don't deserve not one word of the hate
Mind control, all my thoughts are mine to hold
All down in my spinal cord, bitch, this ain't my final form
I got no time for you puppets, take yo' opinion and shove it
I keep my spirit above it, I'm takin' criticism if it isn't ignorant
I'm not concerned with fittin' in, I hit it different
I'm a cartoon but niggas doin' more pretendin' than me
Bitches act offended, get banned on IG
You don't gotta be a hater, you don't like me
Why I keep a grin on my face, on my teeth
All these niggas mad they ain't eatin' like concentration camps
Cut yourself escapin' from leavin' over the nation fence
Most these niggas fakin', not workin', I'm puttin' them aside
Smoke until there's nothin' remainin', I call it genocide
Phoney ass niggas plottin', woah (I call it genocide)
Fruity niggas actin' rotten, so (Bitch, I call it genocide)
On yo shit nigga, you not been, ho (I call it genocide)
I ain't even think of stoppin', though (I call it genocide)
[Part II]

[Segue 1]
Oh?
What's this? (Yuh-uh)
Hahahaha
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch

[Chorus]
I'ma fuck around and Timmy Turner to the tippy top (Tippy top)
I wonder if these niggas really grip these Glocks
Trippin' acid, lippin' flaccid dickin' 'til she give me top, (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

[Verse 2]
Skippin' to the store, I got a red hood on
Salvia, we rippin' out a ten-foot bong
There's a bitch inside my house, she keep on sayin' she's in pain
Yeah, she's sittin' on my couch with burnin' needles in her brain
Divinorum in her veins, guess she was on Lexapro?
The combo made her go insane
She feel calmer on cocaine (True story)
Don't rap for fame (Too whorey), bitch what you sayin'?
I'm Super Saiyan, you super plain (Root for me)
I take my pain, make the music, plant a bomb, can't defuse it
I am calm, I am lucid, they bettin' on that he lose it
Never had it to start with, break you like usin' guitar pick
Constipated, always makin' that hard shit
Contemplated takin' niggas real far, shit
Things happen, niggas switch, you evolve with
Time movin', rhyme smoothin'
Stay focused you will shine through sin
Street tacos get some dimes, who's in?
Know a nigga threw the lime juice in
I know how to live (I know how to live), I know how to die too
You could jump off a buildin', eat mushroom for healin'
Put acid in your eyes too, yuh
[Chorus]
I'ma fuck around and Timmy Turner to the tippy top (Tippy top)
I wonder if these niggas really grip these Glocks
Trippin' acid, lippin' flaccid dickin' 'til she give me top, (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Whippin' up my visions, humans listen to the shit I drop (Shit I drop)

[Segue 2]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, huh, yeah, huh
Yeah
Yeah, huh, yeah, huh

[Part III]

[Chorus]
What goes around, comes around
Goes around, goes around, goes around, goes around, E
What goes around, goes around, goes around, goes around, uh
Spider gang shit (Uh, Spider gang shit)
Goes around uh, what you what (Goes around, goes around, goes around)
(Yeah, Karma)

[Bridge]
Don't be afraid, step right up, step right up
Take your turn at the legendary wheel of karma
But remember that what goes around
Comes back around, goes back around to you (Yuh)
[Verse 3]
What goes around, comes around
Goes around, comes around, goes around, come back to you, uh
My momma told me that was true, people remember like elephants do
People forget all the elements too
Livin' and breathin', succeedin' at music
At leadin' the crew with a passion these niggas ain't move
'Cause they crashin' and talent they rationin'
I'll get a bat, I might bash him in
Grippin' a blade and I'm slashin' him, happen to you
I pull up on 'em, no maskin', I'm smokin' that dope up in Lassen
With DRAIN THE SWAMP blastin', I'm cool
I'm on the beach up in Tahoe, packin' that THC inside a raw cone
I'll be happy when it’s all gone, Mary Jane answer whenever she called on
I had to fall down, I'm smokin' too much
Fold up a post-it, I'm chiefin' a blue crutch
I do not do Dutch, I don't do backwoods
Grab a leaf, only tobacco that smack good
I fucked that, I fucked that bitch in the Safeway
7am and I'm havin' a great day, uh
I'm puttin' on weight like I'm Tay-K
Anime rapper, you sound like a Beyblade
Anime rapper, you hard or you not though?
Sip on yo' Wok and the bars that you pop
Oh, you need a Glock on yo' lap and it cocked
Or you grip yo' cock and you fap while you stalk hoes?
Niggas walk around in dark clothes
Bitch, I'm smokin' at the park, O's
Askin' questions like a narc, no, why you sittin' at the start? Go

[Part IV]

[Segue 3]
Go, go, go, go, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Oh my, oh my (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 4]
P-P-Pussy boy g-get out my way, uh
I'll run up that check before I run any fades, uh
Killin' shit for fun but I ain't catchin' no case, uh
Chillin' in the sun, a villain catchin' some rays, uh
Le-Le-Legalize the fungi, nigga, I eat it anyway
It could start with one guy, nigga, the world got plenty fakes
It don't need another fire with my brothers in the street
They don't show no love, I sight the others, they look industry
Let 'em sleep, goodness me, tell me, what should this be?
Why you in my live talkin' shit? I ain't sayin' shit to you
Keep my pride on my hip, that's a weapon I can't lose
Peep my vibe or keep, zip your lips
Why won't you choose to-to love everybody
Bitch, how many times are you gonna ignore the signs and people's rhymes?
You niggas are retarded, he slid and left his .9
Yo' momma must have dropped yo' ass upon yo' spine

[Chorus]
I feel like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi
We mobbin' through the lobby, that faggot tried to rob me
No ho, like D'Lo, bitch
I feel like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi
I think the copper saw me, but I ain't chain-link-hoppin'
'Cause I ain't see no shit

[Verse 5]
Niggas will believe whatever you tell 'em, if you tell 'em enough
Helpful when you sellin' some stuff, or startin' a war
They rotten at the heart, at the core
I'm plottin' to pour LSD in the reservoir
All over the floor, I'm bringin' psilocybin on tour
I'm hidin' the cure, for fixin' niggas, I'm very sure
Stop bein' depressed, step outside and puff out your chest
He made you the best that's ever gonna jump out the nest
I'm a crushin' a pest, you rushin' to get up like you next
You failin' the test, impale yourself through one of your breasts
Somewhere on your chest
Your heart departs and leaves you with less
Now, look at this mess, bitch, pull yourself together, no rest

[Chorus]
I feel like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi
I know that copper saw me
But I ain't chain-link-hoppin' 'cause I'm up in his whip

[Interlude]
Stop (I know you, motherfucker)
Stop resisting (Fuckin' bitch), stop resisting (Let me go, you fuckin' motherfucker)
Stop resisting (Agh)

[Part V]

[Segue 4]
Sometimes all you need to do is hop on the subway and go
Go

[Chorus]
Let your brain leak out of your ears, uh
Go insane, nigga, punch all your peers, ayy
Pick the kid up, nigga, wipe off your tears
We war-ready, I see you very clear

[Verse 6]
For the tribe, do it for the tribe, nigga, or 'cause you alive
Free what is inside, nigga, I know why you cry
There is somethin' vile, takin' people, ain't no lie
I know, we should smile bigger, because we will die
Momma, why we die? Tell me, momma, why we die?
I know why they hate me, because I will not be shy
I just wanna fly, Daedalus, I have to try
No, don't be a fool, Icarus, you flew too high
Son, move, get out of my way
He was just a boy, wanna play with the day
See him where he lay, now, see him where he lay
Don't succumb to ignorance or you will have to pay with your life
Play with a knife, you could filet what you write with
Stay outta fights, tryna spit or you tryna gang-bang
Pick a type, I don't wanna see no talented rappers dyin' to pipes
I won't front, nigga what you want?
I just wanna see you stunt on these hatin' ass sucker nigga cunts
Kick it punt, I don't fuck with runts, one-one-seven killin' grunts
They in Heaven when I hunt them I hit him then he...

[Chorus]
Let his brain leak out of his ears, uh
Go insane, bitch, I'll punch all your peers, ayy
Pick the kid up, nigga, wipe off your tears
We war-ready, I see you very clear
Let your brain leak out of your ears, uh
Go insane, nigga, punch all your peers, ayy
Pick the kid up, nigga, wipe off your tears
We war-ready, if you not, why you here?

[Bridge]
Go, go, go
One, two—, one, two, three, nigga

[Verse 7]
Bitch, I'm killin' everyone, bitch, I'm causin' a genocide
Fuck these rappin' niggas, they cappin', tap in, pretend to slide
Bitch, I'm in the field like a soldier, I'm makin' fuckin' moves
Made of paper, nigga, I'll fold ya, roll ya and tuck it smooth
Niggas wanna talk, I don't have the time
I be on the block, meditatin', makin' rhymes
Uh, you be hella hatin', got no cock, got no spine
There ain't no debatin', do not talk, make a line
Bi-Bi-Bitch, I keep it on me, like commie or an American
I ain't smokin' with you, but money could make me share it then
Sweeter than some honey and funny 'cause I ain't very tan
Still the darkest rapper, you slappin', I'm killin' every man

[Bridge]
Huh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bih-bih-bih, bih, yeah, yeah
Bih-bih-bih, bih, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Are you still offended? (Are you?)
Let me know (Please do not be)
I care so much about how you feel51Embed

METHHEAD FREESTYLE Lyrics[Intro: Afourteen, BRUHMANEGOD & Eric North]
Hello, my name is Afourteen
And I was not here for the first half of the recording of this song
But, I'm just here to say that meth is bad kids
And you should not be doing that 'cause it will hurt you very bad
Oh, brother, this guy stinks
Ayy, yuh (Yuh)
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Eric North]
Bitch, do not talk 'til you suck on my dick
And my pet got a dick so you sucking his dick
I pull my dick to the back of my hips
And I talk to yo' bitch about horoscope shit
Bitch, fuck a jet, fuck Lears
All of these pipes full of meth
Looking like a big bundle of chandeliers, ayy
Dragging my dick on the floor
And it pushes my dick through the carpet and tickled me more
Pocket full of cum and I might throw it on a heater
Cum burns in my lungs, lil' baby, take a breather, ayy
My pipe broke because last night, I lit it too hot
Now my body super— (Fuck me)
[Bridge 1: JOHNNASCUS]
Yuh-yuh, yuh-yuh
Yuh-yuh, yuh-yuh
Yuh-yuh, yuh-yuh
Yuh-yuh

[Verse 2: JOHNNASCUS]
Stop, stop when I stop (Stop)
Drop when it drop (Drop)
Flock when they flock (Flock)
Dreams run amok
Count sheep, run on me (Run on me)
Counting, they trample me (C'mon)
Trample me, trample me, trample me
Trample me, trample me, tra—
Black goat walk to me in humanoid form
Stabs me through the neck with its black horn
Then I levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate with my own head
Look into the eyes and they are dead
Taste the juicy pupils, I'm my own pupil
Plaster it on a wall
Nothing matters, my new name is Paul (Ow)
Demon of sex, rip my penis from the chest
Give birth through the belly button
My newborn will bring universal destruction
The laws of time will cease to function
[Verse 3: STONEMAN & Wendigo]
I'm in madhouse, ten-down, take the trash out
Stand down, you ain't got eyes, pull the strands out
Walkin' whack, in the alley smokin' smack, still in shacks, shit
Back to back to back to back, I dragged it
Heavy breathin' down ya' neck, it's Mr. Reaper (Mr. Reaper)
Walk up super sneaky, spin 'em like a CD
Drivin' in a car that I be leavin' (I be—, I be—)
Man, I'm tweakin' (Yeah-yeah)
I'm drowsy, fuck, I'm tryin' super hard to focus
In the walls, rats, rats and fuckin' locusts, ha

[Bridge 2: BLCKK]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Suck my fuckin' dick

[Verse 4: BLCKK]
I'ma fuck up yo' whole face, put you in a rat race
Shove you in a bathtub and kick a fucking toaster in it
I'on like you or your friends, little bitch
I can smell that shit from miles, you a snitch
I'ma make ya fucking body start twitching
I'm tryna cut you open, motherfucka, stop flinchin'
And if I had to choose between fuckin' with you and dyin'
I'm tyin' up a knot around my neck and straight divin'
Fuck my life, I'ma hang my wife
I'ma tell the fucking cops the stupid bitch was suicidal
Kill yourself, you a goddamn clown
I'ma force feed ya cyanide and put you on a unicycle
[Verse 5: BRUHMANEGOD & Royalty the Kidd]
Meatman, I'm the muthafuckin' meatman (Okay, okay)
Careful where you creep, man (Okay)
I will fuckin' eat, man (Okay)
I will brew a soup (Yeah)
I am from Peru (Yeah)
Start a war between the continents
Rocket full of pocket lint
Lackin' human common sense (Ayy, ayy)
I don't tote poles, I just toke bowls (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Smoking with some moles you know
I'd never rhyme that shit with chokehold
I feel like a crackhead every day
Bam, Spider Gang, and we want a plot of land (Yes)
You no spider, you's a fly so you get banned (Banned)
Walk around with my hand in my pants (In my pants)
Understand you are not from the strand (Fuck, shit)
So you fucked up, hug the spider truck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna ride when we drive by 'cause we tight as fuck
In the trunk and we finna hit numerous speed bumps
Runner-ups get run over, but only the knees crush

[Verse 6: Lil Darkie]
Yuh, yuh, I have an erection, I have no direction
Slipping on a liquid, non-addictive, like its borin'
But it's not, it got me soarin', I'm trippin' into my core
And I'm waitin' patiently, fade into sofa gracefully
Maple leaf, thinkin' 'bout when the paper leave
How am I gonna pay for weed? (Ugh, fuck)
Kick it like it's Liu Kang or Ip Man
I just wanna stick the tip in
It do hang like a Nike from a shoestring
I'm creepin', doin' acid is my new thing
It seep into my brain and it do sting
Like electricity, he pissin' me off
He going missin' like decision to be soft like a kitten
I'm spittin' niggas into submission
And written 'em out of existence
Like Light Yagami, dark sodomy
She like a meatman, bitch, I'm a butcher I cut off yo' leg
Turn you into a seat, man, I'll make a feet fan
Decrease your prices, I'll increase my vices
Mixed herbs and spices inside of my eyelids

[Chorus: BRUHMANEGOD, BLCKK, STONEMAN, JOHNNASCUS, Eric North & Lil Darkie]
You smoke crack, you is basically Christian
Meth in my pipe, man, that shit hit different
You smoke crack, you is basically Christian
Meth in my pipe, man, that shit hit different
You smoke crack, you is basically Christian
Meth in my pipe, man, that shit hit different
You smoke crack, you is basically Christian
Meth in my pipe, man, that shit hit different

[Outro: BRUHMANEGOD, BLCKK, STONEMAN, JOHNNASCUS, Eric North & Lil Darkie]
Yah, hahahahaha
You better be smoking meth, bitch
Where's my mom? (Where's my fuckin' father?) Spider, Spider Gang, Spider Gang, Spider Gang?
Excuse me, is that Spider Gang? Hello? Is that Spider Gang? Hello?
Some spiders, Spider Gang
S-S-S-Spider? S-S-Spider?
Spider Gang, Spider Gang, Spider Gang
Hey listen, hey listen, hey, hey, hey, it's Spider Gang

HAHA Lyrics[Verse 1]
"Darkie, why you looking so sad?"
Go and take a walk or write a song up on your notepad
For what you have, you should be grateful, why aren’t you more glad?
“Yo, keep on killing shit” “I'll see you later” “Oh, for sure man”
It’s been a fat ass minute, ain't been feeling right
A hypochondriac dissatisfied, my room got no light at times
Fuck all of the people judging you got, no right
And neither do I, the sight of new eyes, a side of you cries
Man, it’s been a minute, I been feeling bad
But I been fighting, I’m enlightened to the fact that I have limited time
I get to spitting these rhymes and lay a shit in your mind
They want my lips intertwined so they can leave me behind
But I will not submit, I will survive
Go make a difference while you are still alive
To be the bigger man requires that you standing high
The bigger man, the more time he fall before he die
There will always be a clown here to fake a smile for you
Running through the town laughing, I despise you too
(Hahahahahaha) Oh did I surprise you cool?
“Get up,” “do I gotta?” “Why don’t you arise, you fool?“
[Chorus 1]
Look at me, I put a face on, wow
Look at me, I put a show on when I go
"HA HA HA HA HA HA HA"
Laugh at the clown and his makeup
How does he feel when we wake up?
I don’t know and I don’t care
I’m unaware of how he faring
Glaring, staring at him so intently
At the fair inside the tent

[Verse 2]
He dance for the people, dance like you mean it
Motherfucker, everybody be too pussy to move
But grip they dick in they room
How the fuck did we ever put a stick in our moon?
It’s funny I’m a cartoon
But keep it realer than a bitch or her nigga that wanna feature
Lemme teach ya how I deal with these reachers that tryna leech us
Keep the fuck to my self and my spiders we throw a circus
For the good of my health, I make entertaining the purpose of it

[Chorus 2]
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
Sing along, have a ball
When the clown slip and fall
HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
When the jester get mad
Put a gun in his hand
BA BA BA BA BA BA
[Outro]
Rest in peace to Robin Williams
Here to act for God and Villains
Brightest person, darkest feelings
Interfere with Satans' dealings

HOLOCAUST Lyrics[Intro]
Ha, hey guys, let's do one of those no melody songs, that’ll be so creative
Yeah, yeah, yuh (Uh)
Ayy, Wendigo, you sound like Kenny Beats right now, hahaha (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Chase the money, chase money, hahaha (Yeah, yeah, huh)
Yeah, oh my god, bitch, yes, yeah, Wendi!

[Chorus]
B-b-bitch, I'm smokin' gas in my chambers like it’s the Holocaust
Pull up with a K on my rifle, that's what the holo cost
Teacher said: "You won't be successful makin' those animations"
Shut yo' apple-eatin' ass up and do some laminations

[Verse 1]
I'd tear a page out the bible if I be out of papers
Idle niggas worshipin' idols, put acid in yo’ wafers
Pastor said: "You won’t be successful gettin' that boomin’'"
Did I ask ya' pussy nigga? You a human
And I'ma be a star soon, wavy like Ahab, hit that nigga with the harpoon
Save me, I may have pulled the trigger, ate some hard ’shrooms
Maybe I'm faded, but I wiggle like a cartoon
Yeah, I feel like a cartoon
I'm in yo' devices, perpetuate your vices in crisis, but I'm the nicest
Always eat your food with spices
Pay attention to the prices, don't be made into a sucka'
You won't have enough for supper, keep ya' numbers on the upper
Tupperware eatin', my seatin' steady on the carpet
I park it and then I spark it, no marketin' hittin' targets
Hit like a guitar pick, that's strummin' or like a drum that be gunnin'
You down for fun, I chuckle, and then I run
[Verse 2]
Run up, I dump it out, he wanna thump it out
Coke in a mountain, my bitch gotta lump it out
Don't do no arguments, pull up, no parkin' it
You hear the sound when my niggas is sparkin' it
I got two hands on that bitch, I won't double back
I got that cookie it double wrap, I got Gelato in Cuban tobacco
I popped a new bottle and blew out her back, ho
I act like a wacko ass
I spit like I'm chewin' on you and don't know what to do with the goo
You a slimy ass nigga, you drip like a garbage bag
Try me, I'll always pull up with a larger mag
Built like an armory, niggas got no chance of harmin' me
Smoke up a garden G, I think it harden me
I am not hurtin', my pain is too far to see
Bitch, if we kick it, no way you say "nah" to weed
Or to poppin' a bottle, we pop him, he waddle
I ain't never dawdle, I'm kickin' the throttle while fuckin' a model
I stay as a drawin', yo' life is a novel and most of it awful (Ass)
Nobody read no more, I stay on the screen, you whore
You pay to get seen, you poor
Don't play for no team, I'm bored, huh?
Talkin' that shit, yo' lip look like an asshole
Walk in that bitch, shoot the bricks out yo' castle
You one them niggas, not purse, it's a satchel
That shit a purse, but it's less of a hassle
Why it got tassels? (Huh?) Why it got tassels on it?
I won't pass the chronic to ya', supersonic-hoover-vacuum, bitch
I pack her smackin' lips, my dick attack her
Slip inside her back-end quick, stackin' chips
Like it's a Pringles can, let's get it crackin' bitch, nigga
Bring it then, bring it then
[Bridge]
Bitch, I'm—, bitch, I'm—
Bitch, I'm smoking, bitch, I'm smoking gas in my chambers like it's the holocaust
Cubie!

[Interlude]
Bitch, bring the hate, bring the smoke (Yuh, yuh)
Bitch, bring the hate, bring the smoke
Bitch, I'm feelin' great
Yeah, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch (Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, huh, yuh)

[Verse 3]
Bitch, bring the hate, bring the smoke, bitch, I'm feelin' great
Chopstick get ate, fuck yo' fate, change your fuckin' state
Under sewer grates, put the stock up to my waist
I make you flip like a cake, fuck yo' zip, yo' cookie fake
I tend to drip when I bake, put tobacco in my face
Bitch, off the rip, I be laced, go outside and catch a case
The pussy wet from the mace, riot dyin' in the street
Keep up the pace, fuck you slowin' for?
We racin' on our feet, we move with haste
I'm amazed, all these niggas fallin' off
Free 14, all these other rappers soft
Spider Gang, choppa cough
Bitch, on paper I look greater than presidents
Set preposterous precedents, got a roster of resonance copper?
Bother the residents proper, stockin' your evidence locker
Medicine set, it'll stomp your head in a dropper
I keep the lead in a yappa, I get to poppin' ya' top
Or ya' legs and sever spit red, and I drop ya' dead and in heaven with papa
B-b-bitch, I'm smokin' heat like an oven, Hansel and Gretel
Sippin' tea inside your neighborhood, cannot handle the kettle
Pullin' up, double glovin', I'm buzzin' grippin' the metals
Spend a dozen and dip before he can settle (Yuh)
He want beef, but he a chicken, I smoke a nigga, rotisserie
You history, I use my machine to make you a mystery like Scooby-Doo
I roll up my doobie, full of the beautiful
Her booty pull me in 'cause she's suitable, irrefutable
Run upon you, make you a victim, I'm the fuckin' shooter
I don't pay for features, I leak 'em, watch your damn computer
Back in high school, they took my scooter, they made me a looter (They did it)
I feel smart, I ain't need no tutor, born a true intruder
[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm smokin' gas in my chambers like it's the holocaust
P-p-pull up with a K on my rifle, that's what the holo cost
T-t-teacher said: "You won't be successful makin' those animations"
T-t-teacher ain't a doctor, got no patience (Nah)

[Outro]
I feel like a cartoon (Yeah, yeah)
Bitch, bitch, I feel like a cartoon (Yeah, yeah, huh?)
(Ha, now we're so original guys, let's add that to the new genre)
(Oh my god, so lyrical, I only deserve when there's so much clou—)33Embed

It's not actually twenty minutes
Duey! Put on something creative
Duey, you're so fucking DIRTY, hehehe
Oh boy
Is there any way that I can put a melody over this?
No
Yeah! I am the melody
Yuh

[Verse 1: (PROD. DUEY DIRTY)]
Hate me, nigga, hate me
You a dummy, funny lady
I’ll name you Katie
Talking shit, you like a baby
I cannot understand
I keep that commie Tommy gun under my pants
In my hands
Make you dance
Fuck a no melody
I am the melody
Kill the beat Marric and I catching felonies
I am not listening to what you’re telling me
I am not buying the shit that you’re selling me
I’m in the cut with Sir Duey, he dirty
I’m making this art 'til I’m well over thirty
Or forty, you buying that clout, get aborted
You niggas unworthy of being awarded
For anything other than being recorded
As some of the worst niggas labeled important
Go put some more in
You like a moron, I ain't talking foreign
But, nigga, I’m touring
Keep up the pouring
That poison yo organs
I'll keep putting powder front of my forehead
Popping them pills
'Til these artists, there’s more dead
Ain't snorting nothing but smarties and warheads (Yay)
[Verse 2: (Prod. WENDIGO X CHRIST DILLINGER)]
Huh, huh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I'm like, and I'm like, hmm
(WENDIGO x DILLINGER beat)
(Real trap shit)
I’m sick of you niggas, I’m sick of you bitches
Go say what you want about me and my riches
You faking statistics
These niggas be leaving they lipstick on top of my dick tip
Pussy, I whiff it from miles away (Okay)
I will never work with niggas that do shit for clout 'cause they dry like a pile of hay (Yuh)
Ain’t nothing new nigga (Yuh)
Ain’t shit to do withcha (Yuh)
I’m pushing shit like Van Gogh or Kanye
In the van, go from LA to The Bay and then back
'Cause I’m very much missing my bae (My bae)
Hair on my dick and my face and I shave it with mace and erase it
Flow into the drain
Ain't came here to play
What you wan' say?
One of these days I'ma blow up like Hiroshima
No, sir, I don’t buy no plays
I don’t even care if you listen
You shitting or pissing
You ain't missing nothing important
Bitch, it’s a blessing that through all the stressing
I get to take what I imagine and form it
You an informant
As in you know about me
You informing the people
You scorn it
Aren’t you bored yet?
To get that clout, all these fakers will forge it
I am so pure and so gorgeous
I’m sick of you niggas, I’m sick of you whores
Pimples in all of your pores
Walk on all fours, can't open doors
Where are my thumbs? I am too dumb
I’m sick of you niggas, I’m sick of you bitches
Go say what you want about me and my riches
I'm swimming in ditches, I'm dipping through gullies
I keep an eye open like Mike who with Sully
I'm bitchin', I'm bitchin' niggas in the kitchen whippin'
I'ma grip a stick and I'ma stir slowly
Niggas be wishing the worst for me
I'ma do me, I'm my own homie
Don't owe you nothing, you don't know me
Ain't wrote for me
I grip a stick, I wrote a poem not a rap
I'll be slapping when the money’s bottle caps
Fall out
With niggas that care about all clout
I'm hanging with WENDIGO
We in New York and we sticker the city
I'm hanging with DILLINGER spitting it witty
I rap on the track like I diddle her kitty
Fast, I get an O for like fiddy
Gas, no, I don't smoke with no biddy
Pass, Spider Gang titty committee
Ass
[Verse 3: (Prod. SOLSA)]
(Shoutout that cute ass nigga Chris, mwah nigga)
Helter skelter
Kill all the beatnicks
Kill all the faggots
And anyone who seek dicks
Face tats and fake plays, uh
Waste cash and make no moves
I got bass cracking my plays, uh
Raise dragon live channel number 2
My mama told me sideways
I would have to get outside, find my place, uh
My mama shares my migraines
Look too hard at me, might get eye pains, uh
Lipstick on my limp dick
Mommy, I want a skateboard
Mommy, I want to rape whores
Mommy, where’s daddy?
Mommy, what that man came for? (Oh)
I don’t like you
I don’t appreciate your tone of voice when you talking to me
Up in a tree, I am so free, caw
Who want to breed with me? (Ah)
Make more of me, make more of me
You are my spawn, look up and feed
I'm in a tree like we KND
Dirty apollo kaka and mazi
Solsa down under he sipping his pee
Hanging a wallaby up in a tree (Ha, ha)
I’m gonna rap like Eminem this time
Spam
A tin can of some ham, lamb, and damn man
Having a grand slam, jabbing it
Mad stamina, damn it
Can famine and cramming an animal
Into a pan, damage the cannibal Hannibal’s hands
Bird berry, walk in my Burberrys, I herd Mary
Edible eating credible medical speaking fellow
My turd scary, smelling like burnt Mary
A word fairy
How did he learn? Where’d he intern?
Fern carrying
With a stern stare, he’ll burn holes in your mental
Fennel seed scent
With a rental key to event
I got lots of tea if you spending
Ain’t meant to be in your business
I gotta go pay the rent
I’m giving up tree for Lent
I’m beating it 'til it bent
[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, no
Stop it

[Verse 4: (Prod. LUISPRODUCEDIT)]
Great, great, great
A couple people in my face, face, face
No other nigga’s songs dropping like the bass, bass, bass do
Thunder blunt, keep it a hunnid, some it laced, laced, K-2
At the summit, ho, you want it take it
Ayy, ayy, ayy, fool
Why you running from the nothing in ya heart? It always catch up
Go and buy some marijuana, I forgot my fucking ketchup
If you step up, better have some shit to say, say, say, to me
Don't waste my time it isn’t real in the first place, fool
I like hairy bitches, uh
I like hairy bitches, uh
Bitches with hair, uh, hmm
I like hairy bitches, uh
I like hairy bitches, uh
Bitches with hair, uh
I'ma do this shit eleven hours in advance
Hey, Luis, do yo dance
Give 8XNE8 back his bands, scammer
If he talking shit I gotta hit him with the ban hammer, ugh
If you hear this nigga, I know that you can't handle
I don't gotta cook a story gripping on a panhandle, ugh
What you talking 'bout? (Uh) Nigga who is that?
Fuck a fake friend, all you pussy bitches stupid cap
Got it out my system like my fecal with the sewer rats
Shaka laka zulu, huh
New year, thirty new yous
What we should do
Is move the fuck on, huh
Walk through the valley, yes, I walk through the rain
And the puddles, nigga, do not get it muddled
All these humans are insane, huh
Half metal Kaiba with a blade runner
Moving like a wave in a cave
Hunter aiming at yo brain
Brain, brain, brain liquid
I feel like Eddy, grip machete
I'm addicted
But not by definition 'cause I kicked it
Fl.vco needs his beauty sleep
Men have become truly weak (Wow)
Why are they abusing me?
Why are they abusing me?
Why are they abusing me? (Wow)
Fl.vco needs his beauty sleep
Fl.vco needs his beauty sleep
Fl.vco needs his beauty sleep (Wow)
Men have become truly weak
Why are they abusing me?
When I've become truly weak (Wow)

(Yuh, yuh, nah, nah, okay)

[Verse 5: (Prod. CXRPSE)]
Shoutout Cadaver, yuh
Hahahahahaha
And for the record, screaming "Yuh" behind your own vocals is overplayed
Punk ass niggas
I will make your corpse dance (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I will make your corpse dance, your corpse dance
I will make your corpse dance, your corpse dance
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Look both ways before you cross the street
Jumping niggas, Frogger, a logger, I'm smoking down a tree
Rotating blades bring him to his feet (Vroom, vroom)
(Staring at you, sipping my lager, I'm standing down the street)
Care about my kin, I'm a father, but do not bow to me
Bow to god, bow to her pussy that drippin' on your meat
Why you never holler unless you got something else you need?
Bitch, I ain't the caller, there’s many niggas who be like me
Feel like me, feel not free, huh
"Sand nigga, dune coon," I heard it all before
Up in the schoolyard, ooh
Bitch that hurt my feelings, I will put you in the fucking floor
Yo soda purple, must be sipping on that codiene
My soda yellow, hydrochloride what a ho mean
Talking promethazine, I will fuck you and your homies
I’m a whore nigga, got some balls? Then show me
Go pee (Psss), on my face, I got no teeth
Water tap on bloody bony finger, Tony!
In New York I sock your cronies if they phony
I'm lonely, my only friends are toy ponies (I'm lonely)

[Verse 6: (Prod. THRAXX)]
Ayy, shoutout that nigga THRAXX, man
Haha, shoutout that nigga THRAXX, haha
Yuh

Fendi, Prada, Gucci on my waist, huh
Then your daughter coochie at my place, huh
Then I slaughter booty like a race, huh
When she gotta poopy, do me face! Yes
That way you can waste less, Hollywood faggot
Shove it up ya ass and then drag it
I'm a hot bitch if I drag it
Bag him and tag it, uh
Don’t get mad at me, I'm a faggot
Walking down Sunset Boulevard, I've had it
BRUHMANE asking what I'm mad at
All of that fag scat
Pussy chatter like he Claptrap
Nap sack full of marijuana and some rap cap
Hate on me all you want, you leave comments on my shit
Companies are scared to post me, prolly ran by half a bitch
You keep race a thing we tripping on, but I don’t give a damn, uh
Color myself in with sharpie just because I can
Yo choppa kill niggas, buss until they dead
My choppa heal niggas, bussin' at they heads
Yo choppa feel bigger, fill it with some lead
My choppa real hitter, I hide it from the Feds
Yo choppa kill niggas, buss until they dead
My choppa heal niggas, bussin' at they heads
Yo choppa feel bigger, fill it with some lead
My choppa real hitter, I hide it from the Feds

[Verse 7: (Prod. CRMSYN)]
Niggas really need to stop, fuck sittin' with us, man
Spider Gang shit
I'm off a quaalude, right now
Go stupid for dumb little bitch with a dick
Lil tranny goin' thirty, I see jay in her lips
Is it gay? Give a shit
Lay you out like my fit
Like a piggy in Hawaii, getting hot up in the pit
Lit a ciggy at the light and then pass it like a spliff
I'm dirty ass nigga, grip her hips at the party
Go stupid, go retarded, make a scene if you get carded
I’m an artist, possibly the hardest ever hit a beat
Sorry, got my nut up on yo fitted sheet
Nigga, how you been this week?
Tell me while she finish me
I am never industry
Semen like I'm in this meat
Streaming down yo sister cheek
Yo plug got a fist of weed
Bitch, go use some Listerine
Or maybe some Mr. Clean
'Til yo mouth is blistering
Headlights bright, hemp wick on my light
In-N-Out Tray Cluch, CRMSYN rolling outta sight
Pack the cookies down tight, then we stop for a bite
Got the fries on my left, lemonade on my right
Outta sight
Rolling so the pine tree bounce around
Never outta green because we always keep an ounce around
RAW paper packet, got the tucks and I attack it
Smoking bleached shit, you ain't got the sharpest tool to hack it
Put it bluntly, can’t receive a dime and try to front me
Then you shouldn’t tell me that you want weed
Tell that fucking cunt, "Leave"
Riding too high to keep a downer round
Turning up a pounding sound
Roll and pass around a pound
Go stupid for dumb little bitch with a dick
Go stupid for dumb little bitch with a dick
Go stupid for dumb little bitch with a dick
Go stupid for dumb little bitch with a dick

[Verse 8: (Prod. LIL DARKIE)]
I produced this song
I made this beat
I'm so proud of myself
Shoutout Johnnascus
Johnny boy, Johnny boy
Playing with his army toys
Johnny tell his mother
Let him hang out with the brawny boys
Scrawny as he is
He hold his own against the bully
He pull out his hair and yell at them
They aren't fully people
Then they beat the fuck out the kid 'cause they want to
Piss on his chucks if he think he know Kung Fu
Bear that he hug tight, take it, now it’s gone too
Off his head with the bite of his front tooth
Bitch what you gon' do?
Outta sight, boutta fight, but he hesitate
Tongue he bite 'til he tell the bigger fella, "Wait it isn’t right"
Pulled out his cabella knife and gut the motherfucker
Ayy, you sucker, tell the others
If they come around this way you getting stuck up
Did I stutter?
Run from Johnny, he’s crazy
"Mommy, I think johnny has rabies"
Save me, that little boy is shady

[Verse 9: (Prod. SONNATIC)]
SONNATIC, wake the fuck up
SONNATIC, wake up SONNATIC
SONNATIC, wake up SONNATIC!
Rickety stick hit Cedric Diggory
Wicker man lit, you sick of me, picket me
Know I been tied up
Finger bobby pin he prick
Backwood lobby, suck my dick
Burn down the hotel like a wick
Wick, wick, flick Bic
Like I said one million times
I feel lightning fill my spine
Sucking, biting when they rhyme
Pissy face, I lick a lime
Kiss my dick tip, you a dime
Keep a quarter in my mind
All times
I don't give one fuck about meeting a nigga
These little ass kids on IG with they pictures
I went to school and I read all my scriptures
Maybe then God will let me into heaven
And I can look down at the pedophile reverends
That burning in hell for not learning they lessons
Steady molesting, no biblical sessions
Ayy, that’s the nigga that gave me depression
What’s up?
Oh hey, just burning eternally
Oh, cool
Wish it was that simple
How to pop a pimple
Squeeze until you bleed
I got momma dimples right up on my cheeks
I am up in the dead of night (Hmm)
Fall in love if you fed him right, yuh
Bitch, I'm up in the dead of night (Hmm, hmm)
Yuh, yeah, yeah, yuh, huh
Rat race, okay
Move your feet if you wit' it
Searching back page, okay
All the cool shit got deleted, got a flat face (Whoo)
My Asian bitch got a fat waist
All you pussy niggas are in last place
All these pussy niggas, know you're shit
All these pussy niggas, know you're shit
Shoutout Killtak

[Verse 10: (Prod. MUPPY)]
So, I just really want this one to sound like a steaming pile of shit
(Listen Muppy, make this beat sound like garbage, mate)
Alright? Oi (At a reasonable miles per hour)
I just took a whip it in the back of my friend’s whip (Okay)
Whip it if the cops wanna start shit, we end it (Yuh)
I just popped a LEMON Quaalude, I was lended
You just on the Xannies, Perc' 30, you pretending
I took off her panties, work dirty like my collar blue
My dollars blue
Niggas paying Darkie for a comment and a follow too
Hollow foo, industry will swallow you, all of you
Where that nigga Yahweh you was callin' too
Nowhere, nowhere to be found
See you pound on your head
He has to be around, right?
Sound bites, as in wave eats
He don’t save fleets
Say please, bitch, you will obey me, nigga
Hey team! Let’s go make a movie should be way clean
Lights, camera, dick under my UZI with a gay beam
Spray cream
Hahaha, yuh, uh
Oh, man, I'm so gay
Meth-head, lay down on my death bed
Oh yeah!
I love the way it hold me so bad
Oh man!
Nigga send the digits if you will not send a fucking location
I'm that nigga usually cool but now I got no patience
Pussy niggas speaking on me unwisely
Pussy niggas tweak in they tweets most likely
Would these niggas get on they feet? Advise me
I can see you clear off this weed, no Visene
I can see you clear off this weed, no Visene (Whee)
I can see you clear off this weed, no Visene (Ooh, yuh, yuh, yuh)
I can see you clear off this weed, no Visene
I can see you clear off this weed, no Visene
I can see you clear off this weed, and I’m high, G
Dirty nigga, take care of your personal hygiene
I can see you, I spy with my little eye
A little man, small fry on his inner thigh
Hop a fence, leave yo grandma behind
I feel something tense, wrap around and it bind, yuh
Now I know what you're thinking
This song is getting kinda to the end (True)
That means some cool shit is about to happen
[Verse 11: (Prod. LIL CUBENSIS)]
Ayy, CUBENSIS, play the beat
Hahaha, this nigga sound hairy, hahahaha
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Fuck you niggas talkin' 'bout?
Bitch, you hella pussy
Many kitties flockin' round
In yo city, talking loud
I can see you walking out
While I'm rapping
I'm a dog owner
I yell at the cat then
Kick his backend, uh
I know why these niggas yapping
'Cause they mad that I'm attacking
Everything they holding dear
Being racist, live in fear
Being hateful, Killing queers
Let a Darkie smoke marijuana while walking trail of tears
Bitch, I rip out my hair, I wanna put niggas on they rears
You can say what you ponder, we kinda don't even need you here
Suicide, commit suicide, yeah, I tried to
Sad, turned mad when I figured I was lied to, huh
What the fuck you offer to a nigga like me?
Run that shit back to the curb, off a nigga, we’ll see
In the cut, sew it up, dealing stitches, no fee
Straight mixing up this shit, bathwater, cup of tea
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh
My boys on my back
12 pull up when we shooting for a track, wack
Slide to the crib in the back
Baby ass kid got a bib for the yak
Black
Sky with the brake dust
And under it gun they make bust
And under it LA break trust
And under it all they fake us like
Mannequins up in the pike
These Anakin bitches is killing the light
Sike
I’m biking bitch go take hike
I ain't yo Darkie and you ain't my type, yuh
Light fire to grass get water or rock on it
Ground pound like I taught her to hop on it
Round sound, no squares in my circle
One loud round when we passing the purple
No bumming, no hits off of Brahman, I call that shit robbin'
He leave you red like a robin
Birdie hop out of the nest without wearing a vest
On his chest, already mobbin'
Pull up and you stutter
My face in the neon, it making you panic (Panic, huh)
Manic depressive unless I got blunt in my face
Little boy, what you be on? What’s happening?
Faking (Ugh), illusions and smoke on reflectors
They never said they protectors (Ugh)
Protect us I bet, then wet us
Let us be sheep for the lettuce (Ugh)
Get us
They judge us ain't even met us
I gotta hop on my shit right quick (Ugh)
We swimming the current, they trying to net us
Curran put bruv on the shit right quick
'Til Spider Gang get up

[Outro]
That's the whole song
It's done right now16Embed

​rap music Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, that's groovy, man
[Gibberish]
My mind flies, wide eyes, I cry
For the people that, for the people that, for the people that, for the people that died
Why expect a thing? Why try?
Really? Nothing? This fucking guy, call the label!
Why accept a thing, why do we buy, into it?
Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
In the wrong time (Wrong time)
Oh well
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody dance no more
See the paint up on my pants I tore, now eye melt off
And I bet I'll see you lurking in the corner, you whore
I'm in yo' brain and I'm in yo' head and I'ma loiter, we poor
I can't afford to be bored
And when I'm riding with the gang, we on the border, be warned
And when I'm yelling I be feeling what I'm born to be for
And I be smelling all the elements, there's gonna be war
And I'll be ready, I'll be ready, I'll be
Standing up the wall that they build now
Knock you down, divide the whole field, cow
I can't fall, I never go to sleep
For niggas sucking on my dick, you better get up out here
[Verse 1]
Fight club, nigga, don't talk about it, walk up out it
Fucking with the spider, nigga, pick a daisy, kick a bucket (Ahh)
Save my life, the blood in my eye white
Don't talk right, you might cause a knife fight
Mama told a nigga better go hard, go hard
Think a darkie doing good so far, so far, uh
I'ma kill this shit like forever, that's longevity
You can eat yo' fill of whatever, I got everything, uh
Make my image into something you'll remember
When I'm smoking with my niggas, we burning the same ember
When I kill it, I be killing December right through November
Niggas pushing buttons, they touching a nigga temper, right
I got my fair share of problems
I got my fair share of problems, any nigga wanna solve 'em?
You see a lick then you rob him
I see a lick then I stop on the block and I pause him
Sir, I been at home eating ramen
Are you aware that I do not agree how the law been?
Mama keep sobbing, crying
Give me a dollar and I can
Buy things for her, I can try being sober
Getting high is a lower form of life
Going slower than a slug or a bug in arachnid webs
I'ma stack these heads in the back, pretend
They're not there or that I got hair (Do you got that stuff?)
Do you got that stuff?
Do you got what it takes now?
We can find out quick
We can find out quickly
Oh yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah

Ain't nobody dance no more
See the paint up on my pants I tore, now eye melt off

JACK DANIELS Lyrics[Intro]
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I took that fella round back to the water hole
Yee-hah
It's me everybody howdy, Lil Darkie, with another Christian hit
(Yuh)

[Verse 1]
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I turn that critter to dust and it’s audible
I turn your 10-gallon hat to some particles
Can’t even read what they wrote in my articles
I’m so illiterate
I can’t even read a little bit
I keep a banjo my hip and I diddle it
Middle kid, I got some siblings
Rat eat the scrap on the floor and the niblings
I keep a bat I keep score in my backyard
My daddy fat and he poor it ain't that hard
My dad republican but he live on unemployment
Farming don’t bring no enjoyment
Kids in my town is afflicted with opiates
Heroin needles addiction is copious
Never appropriate, uncle yelling 'bout the Soviets taking over his associates
[Bridge]
I’ma country boy in my heart
I’ma country boy in these parts
I’ma country boy on my land
I’ma country boy I don’t bend
Uh, want some freedom I’ll deliver
Uh, out in Russia you might shiver
See the moonshine inside my liver
George shot Lenny by the river
(Uh)

[Verse 2]
Dipping tobacco inside of my lip again
Ripping the back off a pack and then stick it in
Spit it inside of a jar get my nicotine
Get the fuck outta my town man I’m sick of them
Methamphetamine abusers
We the better men they losers
The beggars cannot be the choosers
I be posted with my crackers
Some of us blacker but that ain't a factor
We packing that heat and it’s hotter than barbecue
I’m with my dogs, that’s Scooby Doo, Marmaduke
Put up a wall and I barb it too
That way it harming you
Hoppin' it that’s what that karma do
I conceal carry my .38 special
Especially for any devilish vessels
My rifle don’t trifle on who in its sights
If he evil my Deagle be taking his life
And that eagle I keep on my Jeep and my Chevy
It fill up my heart till a part of me heavy
The levies they creaking
The plains and the peaks
And the valleys from Georgia
To Cali I’m seeking
For destiny manifest
Definitely can attest
I despise everyone
Anyone’s ran against
One reason or another
Whether northerner or southern
I prefer less stubbornness inside the governance
I want my vote to feel less like another miss
And like they thinking 'bout us normal citizens
I wonder if there’s any time to fit us in
Too busy banning self-defence
Everybody’s tense
None of these liberals are making any sense
Now there’s some nazi’s that took up residence
Voted for Donny and I’m still scared of Pence
What the fuck is the whole country coming to?
Rappers and Muslims is dying and gunning too
Police get shot and they doin' the killing
Put end to this shit God willing
All of the innocent blood we spilling
Everyone gun on yo arm no kneeling now
Here, pop a pill if it’s tearing you down
Welcome to new America town!
[Refrain]
Yee-haw
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
Stepping on my land?
Then you gonna catch the weapon (Yee-haw)
What you catching? Lead from a Smith and Wesson (Alright)
I'm in the field at 4 o'clock so why you pressing?

[Verse 3]
“City folk, city folk, we don't like you city folk”
Pull up to my farm
And I'ma harm you
Let the 50 poke
Redneck man
Touch my daughter I'ma slaughter you
Caught her by the water with a commie
So I shot her too, Waterloo
South Carolina and Nevada too
Proud to be American it
Isn’t getting hotter dude
It isn’t getting hotter
I'm a martyr, I'm a patriot
Pull up in a Ford, with the rifle
Man, he ate the shit
Pull up on the tractor, with my pastor
You an atheist
We don't need guns!
On the web? You the laziest
Craziest!
To think you can stop me
Popping these enemies
And I ain't stopping the dropping
'Til I get ten at least (Drop 'em)
I tow magnums, drink
Jack Daniels, not Hennessey ([?] it)
Dragon’s breath in my weapon
Get them from Tennessee (Pop it)
I could bury you, open carry the remedy ([?] it)
Whipping out my property stop like Kennedy ([?] it)
Home of watching Fox News like it’s the fucking playoffs
All these politicians smoking crack rock and getting payoffs
Taxpaying
Track laying
Hopping out the back spraying
I'm voting
Nine toting
Won the war and I'm gloating
Beer drinking
Clear thinking
'Merican man
At the beach
A seagull is wearing a can
[Chorus]
Stepping on my land
Then you gonna catch the weapon (Yee-haw)
What you catching? Lead from a Smith and Wesson (Alright)

[Refrain]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
1-2-3

[Chorus]
Stepping on my land
Then you gonna catch the weapon (Yee-haw)
What you catching? Lead from a Smith and Wesson (Alright)
I'm in the field at 4 o'clock so why you pressing (Yee-haw)
Pressing on me I'ma teach your boys a lesson

[Outro]
Yippee-ki-yay motherfucker!
Yuh, yuh
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I turn that critter to dust and it’s audible
I turn your 10-gallon hat to some particles
Can’t even read what they wrote in my-8Embed

Jimmy, would you please put on that one beat?
Damn Jimmy, this some serious gourmet shit!

[Verse 1]
Huh, when the world end Imma be with you
It doesn't matter if you hot or if you cool, nah
Niggas want you dead it’s all connected, I’m a fool
Ugh bitch you made of water you related to the pool

And grilling damn my
Skin like some cinnamon

Friends is some winners man
And I’m the man too
"Can I be a spider too?"
I don’t know can you?
This is just my clan
We gon' run it until we can’t dude

Be forgotten that’s all you can do
Plan to, run up them bands
And buy some canned food
[Verse 2]
What you doing wit' yo' time?
Ain't doing shit you could you asking how to spit a rhyme
Get off yo' ass there ain't a class
I bet you wish you find
A million dollars on the street

Ain't read the book my Momma gave me
And I owe it to that lady
Kill this shit and fix my mind
Imma crack the cover
Keep a grip up on the spine
I ain't read a book in like a year, maybe it’s fine

[Outro]
When the world end Imma be with you
When the world end least I read it through8Embed

BIG WAR Lyrics[Intro]
Wendigo, have you seen my fucking lighter?
Awr, where's my fucking light-
Oop - found it
Flick
Lalalalalala

[Chorus 1]
Yuh, blow up
I did it, I could do it again, my friend
I run up then I detonate, bring your end
Send shots at your temple that you defend
Send planes if you fucking with Allah's men

[Verse 1]
Made by the USA, bitch
The head of your country is a bumbling racist
A drone took my family and he still won't say shit
Behead 'em on camera to display they faces
Allahu Akbar
All you are not hard
Blow up a cop car
Jetting through the desert
You be slowing on the Wockhardt
You can not be hard
Causing a jihad
All of my brothers in a suicidal pea-pod
Grip on an AK
Hear him say "Mayday"
72 virgins, talking my pay-day
It is my time now, ready to die loud
Lelelelelelele
[Chorus 1]
Yuh, blow up
I did it, I could do it again, my friend
I run up then I detonate, bring your end
Send shots at your temple that you defend
Send planes if you fucking with Allah's men

[Verse 2]
Sharia, shawdy act so naughty (Nah)
Cover her from head to toe
So I can't get my body hard
RPG, are we free?
No we're not, they're arming me
Come and see how it be inside of the Middle East
Or at least follow us on Twitter, keep up with recruitments
Who we looting?
We get our boots and guns we use for shooting all the Jews and who we choosing to show up on our YouTube and pull in views
When we slit his throat and leave his body oozing
Fuck a infidel, throw his body in a well
Free my brothers Ali and Muhammad from that island cell

Pull up on the goat and I might fill ya type beat

Killer type beat (Uh)
Pull up on the goat and I might fill ya type beat (Yeah)

Terror type beat (Uh)
Pull up on him, hit him, cause an error type beat
[Chorus 1]
Yuh, blow up

I run up then I detonate, bring your end
Send shots at your temple that you defend
Send planes if you fucking with Allah's men
[Outro]
Blow up, blow up
I'm about to blow up
Filled up with emotion and some potion had to pour up
No cup, grow up
Bitch, you better grow up
Slow up

[Bridge]
Come on boys, we're going to kill some Arabs

Hit 'em with a bigger stick

Pole, pole, pole

[Verse 4]
This land was your land, but now it's my land
I'm very happy that you're in pain
This land was your land, but now it's my land
I'm very happy that you're in pain
We want your oil
Under the white sand, we're sending men to put some bullets in your brains
Bitch nigga wanna come my way
Wanna pull up in the Hummer
The drummer, he might play
I run up on ya bunker
I'm thumpin' ya night day

They can't even sight me
I'm special operations
We a special population
See us taking over areas and setting up a station where we basing our location information on the nation in relation to you niggas

[Bridge]
Bad reputation

Fuck is really going on in this place...
Alalalalalala, I’m crazy
Somebody listen to me
[Verse 5]
We're tired, we're tired of fighting your battles
Not cattle the stick and it rattle
Don't tread on me tread on me
The true american
Hyper aware I am
I won’t go there again
I won't go back...
Fuck your wars for money, for economy
Autonomy is dying, and a lot of me believes it
Leave it in the past
Keep buying more gas, keep starting your wars
Keep sending more tours to Afghanistan and Taliban hand to hand to fight em now I understand?
And we increasing demand for all those manufacturers to capture us
Reactors in the east
Our nation sending shit to rapture em
Tractor by the farms the old pasture
Feeling fractured from the folks that live as actors in LA, and that's a factor
How the crackers and the blackers and the darkies in between ain't gonna do shit if we hang everyone
Who got a different stature?
What you mean? what you mean? what you mean?
What you mean? what you mean?
What you mean, bitch?
Pointing our beams and creating teams
And paying our taxes to generate means of harm
Extremely alarmed, they got us on Fox
Let's sell some more arms, let's make some more weapons
Keep stepping in places you do not belong
Keep singing our songs, go write others' wrongs
Don't buy Chinese products 'cause you're supposed to love us
There's nothing above us but stars in the sky
Then get addicted to bars and get high
A big pharma supply make our will to live die...
I prayed to join the military 17 years young
I know 21-year-olds who bitch and let their tears run
I know grown niggas that ain't never been near guns
You fuck around and die then I'm deciding when we're done

[Outro]
Eagle Scout, (yeah)
Deagle shout (chch pow)
Don't tread on me, I'm an Eagle Scout
Keep lead on me, let the Deagle shout
My dead homies told me weed 'em out
Post up lowkey like a sauerkraut
Big war, big war, big war, big war, big war, big war, big war, big war
[Interlude]
Attention! I'd like to have a moment of silence for all of the niggas that perished last year in the fucking game. All the niggas that gave the fuck up, all the niggas that wasn't good enough, all the niggas who died in battle, I salute you now!
Ten-hut!
Hoo-rah!
Hoo-rah!

[Outro]
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
God bless the USA
God bless the USA
God bless the USA10Embed

COLOSSAL CONFLICT Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro]
(Ahahahaha, wow)

[Verse 1]
Wow, another fucking war
I am not even surprised anymore by the state of affairs
I feel like nobody cares that there are people dying
Money we supplying, drone is flying (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Killing, filling the air
The smell of blood and it's paired
With gasoline and I mean it
You don't know who, what, or where
Or why we fighting the terror
I'm scared that breaking news for faking views
And I don't know why they can choose
Who live or die, they taking dudes and telling us after
Bitch, I appreciate safety
But lately, I feel like they think we non-sentient matter
And all our talk is some chatter they can ignore (Huh?)
Man, fuck where I was born, I ain't choose it
I could lose it if decision do form
And if you killing some nigga
Then let us know who he is (Okay)
'Cause this some World War I
Franz Ferdinand biz' (Yeah, yeah)
I don't know any of you niggas, killing people for why?
This is some anarchy, chaos in a clever disguise
They hold it before your eyes (Yeah, yeah)
And hit the switch, bitch, which?
Group of murderous faggots, lay in a ditch
There might be a good reason to put them in the dirt
But I don't have a say in when they go and send in the hurt
I feel weak, I feel like I am not allowed to speak
'Cause I'll be labeled a freak or someone's mama will tweak
I'm misinformed, I don't know why the desert was stormed
Or why we made Al-Qaeda, gave them K's
And later deformed
Maybe Soleimani was a commie, or a traitor, or killer
And GOP is spitting facts, accurate therefore realer
But on the news all I see is people fixing to bicker
And we believe what we exposed to on IG and Twitter
For goodness sake, look at all the mess that we make (Huh, huh)
When are we all gonna work together? Sharing our cake (Huh, huh)
Instead of coming off fake and taking after the snake (Huh, huh)
People take to street looking for something to break
Instead of fixing the place
Allahu Akbar, God is great
Killing humans is not hard
Easy way out: be a rapper or rock star
Speaking your truth in the back of a cop car
Allahu Akbar
I-I-I-I don't fuck with none of yous
Stepped up in Iran and I'm thinkin' 'bout what gun I choose
AR-15 with a hollow point round
And don't fuck with America if you don't got a son to lose
[Part II]

[Refrain]
America the free
America the free, America the brave
America the home of the happiest slaves
That's America to me, I'm married to the game
Let the bombs rain down from the bottom of planes
America the free, America the grave
America the land of immediate fame
What's America to be when it has no name?
The land of the bones and the red bloodstains

[Verse 2]
Hide behind the trees while they still there
Let's go save the bees from the bad air
Segregation nation, no free speech
Revelation burning what we teach
Man, you hate to see it, I'm American
Make some enemies and try to bury them
Pick your brothers up, you maggot, carry them
Let's destroy some camels and some caravan
In the name of God (Name of God and country)
Do it for my ma (The devil doesn't want these)
Missiles, fiscal crisis imminent
Buy more drones, take lives of the innocent
Stand and say our nation's pledge
Revolution on the edge
I don't wanna see you dead, why can't all of us be friends?
I don't want your people fed, and all that I can see is red
This is America, too
We're making the hysteria cool to the internet, people
We might make AI, colossal conflict
End or start the robot bomb hit
Until then we fight for water
Oil, food, and resource squabbles
Seen the bottom of many bottles
And I still can't forget Sir Donald
Left, right, left, right
Left, right, oorah!
All hail business, President Poobah (Poo, poo)
Blow on his dick, your bugle or tuba (Poo, poo)
Take a bit of oil, recoil, and then sell a bit
All the lower people don't matter and they irrelevant
Hello Mister "I am supporting this man or woman"
She comin' to summon a demon, so go support a delegate
Oh, how I love this political system
The Founding Fathers would think that we listened
Make America great? It never really was
Make it great for the first time because (Huh)
Then maybe the people would drink clean water
So our children can think
They grow so smart that we don't need death
To help our planet become less of a shit hole
Pistol
M16s and AKs galore
Make more, make more, to make more the gore
[Segue]
Move out, soldier! Move out, men!
We gotta take back that hill!
What do you think you're doing, Private Johnson?
Get moving!
But sir, what the fuck are we even doing here?
That's between President Trump and God, soldier
Now get your lousy ass up off this Iranian dirt!
Ah, yes, World War III
I remember it like it was yesterday
But do you know what really slapped in my day, sonny?
[Part III]

[Chorus]
Churches burning
Oh God above, make sure that the
Earth is turning
They tryna take our love away
How concerning
I wanna help you either way
Stop your hurting
And let’s move on to brighter days

[Verse 3]
World War III, fire all I see
But I'ma keep on moving 'til I got no feet
Yeah, that World War III hittin' differently
I see the missiles in the air shooting at Qassem
Yeah, that World War III, and then World War IV
Why you fighting when there's partying and liquor to pour?
Yeah, that world war? No more, por favor
Put down the AK-47, get yo ass on the floor
And tell Kim Jong-un, "Look up at the moon!"
How could you hurt another person, make a nuke go zoom?
And that impending doom
I don't wan' lay up in my bed thinking it ending soon
I wanna see a better day where ain't offending you
And I'm befriending everyone upon this planet
If you killin' for no reason, go to hell, goddamn it (Huh, yeah)
[Chorus]
Churches burning
Oh God above, make sure that the
Earth is turning
They tryna take our love away
How concerning
I wanna help you either way
Stop your hurting
And let’s move on to brighter days
Churches burning
Oh God above, make sure that the
Earth is turning
They tryna take our love away
How concerning
I wanna help you either way
Stop your hurting
And let’s move on to brighter days

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Hey, hey-yeah
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Brighter days, brighter days, brighter days

[Chorus]
Churches burning
Oh God above, make sure that the
Earth is turning
They tryna take our love away
How concerning
I wanna help you either way
Stop your hurting
And let’s move on to brighter days

[Outro]
I'ma dance off into the sunset with you
Ready?
I'm in the sunset now19Embed

​banana pie Lyrics[Verse 1]
Misunderstanding running rampant
I can see it in your eyes
Vision tainted by the lies of every man
Banana pie, so sweet and soft
Never enough
I'm left with crumbs, I have to buy
More of it to satisfy my craving
Climb a ladder
I'm on the edge of the world
Hang my feet off of the side
No one really wants to die alone
But some of us will try
For this life, we don't apply
Just appear one day, for why?
Cover up your pain, get high enough
To spread your wings and fly
[Chorus]
It's okay to cry (Oh, it's okay to cry)
My sweet banana pie (Sweet banana pie)
It's okay to cry
My sweet banana pie
My sweet banana

[Verse 2]
Yes, I am strong deep inside (Me)
But I haven't always known
Guess it's safe inside my home
And I despise this fucking phone
Tell me act like I am grown
Tell me care for what I own
If I've got to give it back to someone
This life is a loan, this life is a loan
This life is a loan, this life is a loan
Honey, chin up and be strong
Baby, this life is a loan

[Outro]
And you don't need banana pie33Embed

POSTED IN THE DVRK Lyrics[Intro]
These are going to be the only adlibs on this song
These words that you're hearing right now, they're in the adlib track and you're not gonna hear any more

[Verse 1]
Godzilla walkin', got Zilla bumpin' Bluetooth
Stomp on his jaw if he sell me something too boof
So mad, trigger happy, bitchin', you a whole goof
Nomad nigga, walk around, I'm keepin' no roof
No name niggas always blow theyself like Cobain
No shame, detestable, you flexible like Lo Mein
Go brain, fly away, get higher than the low pain
Propane, blowing up, you slowing up, see no fame
Bitch, I'm busy, too busy to fuck around
Hey, hit that stizzy, bitch, asking about my pound, nah
Might go missin', my mission is to be free
And all you niggas ain't controlling what I be
That bitch got high from drinking my piss
I might fly away, I ain't thinking of kids
Yet Mom, wet bong ripping
Ain't sippin' on tech, ack, yack
Backwoods, but I got fronto on deck, black pack
[Interlude]
Sac Town, sack up in my backpack
Black MAC, liable to rack back if I see that hack lack

[Verse 2]
Hit him with that ra-ra right inside his car-car
Sitting on the tar-tar, floating where the stars are
Bitch, I'm busy, too busy to fuck about, uh
Jealous-ass kid, he keep trying to block my route (Okay)
My perspective, effective at spotting bullshit
You, defective objective is let the full clip
Dump like a dookie, he knew me and now he do not
Hump on his groupies, they coochies and number two spots
Clump my feeling, I'm peaking off t-t-two tabs
Thump my ceiling, it's peeling like it's a new scab
Trust no one, hurt me no more
I fuck with 'em from rich to poor
Flat Earth, all turf from pole to pole
Don't drink from the tap, they tappin' your soul
I work harder than the president, save the elephants
Disrespect and I'ma hit ya, set a precedent
Listen to me, I'm the reverend, my decree will never end
I believe these truths are self-evident, Heaven-sent
All hail Satan and shit, on the TV, see me debating a bitch
As if our moves aren't scripted and writ
By the same motherfuckers own yo' DNA bits
Bitch I'm busy, too busy leading the free world
What about the rest of it? Make it into a Sea World
Less of it for fauna, like llamas and all the wee squirrels
Give it to Osama, the bomber, at freedom we hurl
[Outro]
Contrary to popular belief, darkies do not require adlibs to complete songs
(Hey, hey, can somebody tell that guy to shut the fuck up?)5Embed

SHOOT PEOPLE YOU DON’T LIKE Lyrics[Intro]
Hello, I'm Lil Darkie

You ain't even throw the cushion
Uh, I’m the motherfucker on a mission, yuh

Better buck up 'fore you get fucked up too
With the gang and the strap
Tonight like hell

Let it bang 'cause I love that sound
Men insane when I hit my green
I will hit whatever you in
Set you free from a world of sin
[Chorus]
Shoot people you don't like, why the fuck not?
Bloodshot, Tough luck, Going through a rough spot
Yuh, shoot people you don't like
Shoot people take their life, yuh

[Outro]
Ay, listen, kids
If someone ever steps on your shoes or looks at you funny
I'ma tell you what you do, alright?
What you do is you pull out the strap
Then you aim it at their head
And then one, two, pop
You shoot 'em in the head and they're gone
It's easy like that, one, two, they're over
Bing batta boom (Chh, brrrt)7Embed

YEAR OF THE CAP Lyrics[Intro]
Mayday
Mayday, mayday, mayday
Mayday, mayday, mayday

[Verse]
That nigga walked in this bitch with a AK
Got yo head spinning like Beyblade, mayday
My meat grade A, yo weed, payday
Bumboclaat bitch, nigga dripping like lady
Mayday, these days nobody will fade me
Nobody do how they say they
Year of the cap, year of the lie
Popping a cap, you cannot cry
Nobody change, nobody try
What else is new?
Living for why? Living for who?
Living to die, living to burn, living to fry
Wait for your turn, open your eyes
Infinite screams, infinite sighs
I don't give fuck
I don’t give fuck about you, nigga
I don't even know what you do, nigga
Run up on you with the tool, nigga
Fix him right up, go to school, nigga
Act like a clown, you come off like a fool, nigga
I'm in the pool with the clique and we cool
Bigger man, bigger sack, nigga
I’m in the back with ya bitch
Red and black figure
Lurk in the dark with the cracks, I'm in that fissure
I pay attention, I am observant
You don't get mentioned, make you my servant
I am not underground
Bitch, I've been breaking it
Don't fuck with other sounds, niggas is faking it
I don't wan' see what you doing
Niggas is mad that they losing
Every nigga I see that ain't doing enough
Always post on the internet, they gon’ be up
So I stay on top of my shit
Lil’ bitch, I am glad I don't fit
I am an Indian, I’m not a spic
I am a Darkie, Cubensis a spic
Didn't get to pick
Not gonna cap, not gonna lie
We can get down, we can get high
Oh, I forgot mike is also a spic, that be my guy
He has a dick, I have a dick on my waist too
My girl got pussy, but she keeps some cake
Ooh, what? You want a nigga to lie?
Wendigo got the word freak ‘bove his thigh
Solsa from under
Bruhmane look like he could plunder without a blunder
Uh, you
You cannot keep up the pace
Dillinger got the word sleep on his face
Facts
Shout-out my niggas that's eating
Sit in my room and yell until my teeth grin
I jack off into a chip bag
Niggas too pussy to talk about dicks that are in they draws
Fuck media, fuck laws
Look at your self, look at your flaws
Demons tapping into niggas with bars
Female rappers yelling make me get hard
Not gonna lie, not gonna front
I hear you sigh, ho, what you want?
I smell your cunt, bitch, and it stunk
Just like a skunk
Bring back punk, bring back rock
Nobody talk, see what it done to the block?
No one know they neighbors
No one know who gave us everything that we got
[Outro]
This is how every rapper raps
"Run up on my hip with a stick and I let that shit hit [Gibberish]"
Insolence (Unacceptable)
Rap differently
Unacceptable
Stop rapping the same way every song
You rap the same way every song2Embed

DARKIE STILL CANNOT RAP Lyrics[Part 1]

[Intro: Brahman]
Wait at the gates for me, my nigga, I'm dying
Fate is a weight, debate the state of my mind
Generate hate, emotion I cannot find
I’m feeling great and I don't have enough time
To tell you all I want to, ain't no way to rewind
The way it seems to taunt you, the world is not kind
At moments, it can haunt you when shit’s out of line
Just know that I'll be gone too and no one will mind

[Verse 1: Lil Darkie & Brahman]
And no one will mind
That you were one of many who were thrown to the swine
That you were sipping Henny or you tripping on wine
That someone took a bullet, put it into your spine
Just smile and know that no one will mind
Any moment body might break
Anybody wanna die baked?
Fuck yeah at this rate
Pick a date “real late”, hoe, it ain't no debate
With no mind
With nothing in your head
I'll speak my truth 'til I'm dead
Fuck every fed, I'm getting red in the face
I ain't put you in your place
Will you submit? Bow down!
Stare at your feet or, “Look up at me take a seat”
Suck on your teeth
I go so dumb on the beat
Because I know one day I’ll be under some feet
Like you!
[Verse 2: Brahman]
Like you and me
Best friends forever in the fucking trees
Less than a feather, better sail the breeze
Atoms gather in the sky and in the land and seas
Murderers and people that defend the bees
Women and they children and the men they please
Sky dimming, I be grinning I can end this tease
At what’s it like to be a god brought to bend his knees

[Part 2]

[Intro]
Tell us another one, Darkie!
Okay!
CUBENSiS, let it ride for a minute
I need to go drink more alcohol
Okay, okay
This is a story about Indian Jesus
[Verse 1]
There was once a boy who was born the color of indigo
Mother, father, everyone didn't know ’til he hit the floor
Born inside a prison and missing, something immaculate
Ain't got no mortality, take his parents aback a bit
Careful what you wish for, your piss poor
Decisions get you set back just a bit more
You sucking on a sack of dicks
Lack the wit to kill a demon screaming it's a sack he hit
Wacky kid, as in he a goofy one, tacky shit
You be done
If you really evil, he can start a war
All his homies dying
Now his heart is cold, particle
Weapons from the gods that incinerate and irradiate
Stepping on the dirt, hate can turn the earth to a scary place
[Bridge]
All the gods we know have to die
All the gods we know have to die
No one knows where they lie
But they live on inside your mind
You can be whatever that you find is fine

[Verse 2]
So he won the war that many people said was great
Went into the wood for a minute to meditate
But there was no devil to influence him to break
Just a hungry hunter who wanted some wild steak
Wait
Do I see a foot in the distance?
I'mma aim, ain’t no missing
I gotta feed all of my children
Bitch listen, bitch listen
Let the arrow fly and see an era end
I'm not terrified, you're a long-lost friend
See, in a past life, you were a man, I took your life away
Now it was your pass at me, I forgive you on any day
Karma is a bitch and she slapping with tight hooks
Armor on my head but it jabbed in my right foot
That was the way Lord Krishna died (uh)
Flew up in the sky, what a radical guy (uh)
That little darkie never fold or gave in
Now I wanna rap about the place I stay in
[Part 3]
[Verse 1]
Ándale Ándale
Arriba arriba
I run like a cheetah
Make art like I'm Frida
The cedar I'm rolling
I feed her my pole 'n explode, mamasita
Want salt, margarita
My choppa, he kick like a burro
I'm gripping the pole like a churro
Go hit up the bureau
And tell him selling this white by the kilo
You going extinct like the parrot from Rio
Go get yo' dinero
Throw you in a barrel like Walter
Your fault, you behaving real feral
You falter, you slip and we catch you, you soaring
Start walking at night other end by the morning

[Hook]
It's a long beach
It's a long beach
It's a long-, it's a long-, it's a long beach
It's a long-, it's a long-, it's a long beach
It's a long beach
It's a long beach

[Verse 2]
We're plantin' marijuana outside of school
Pantin' very hard I sound like a monster
Give ya kid some acid inside the concert
Give the kid a quarter, I can make it to a sponsor
Give you a gram and I can make you to a customer
Niggas go ham crazy if you wanna bust some more
You in a jam, become a nigga who want some dough
You is a lamb, the prey and you not a foe

[Verse 3]
I ain't threatened
Nigga got a weapon but easy with what he rappin'
You had me for like a second but now you coming in second
I reckon you gotta tap it
You tweeting more than you packing (yeah)
You ain't never shot nobody, you ain't starting now
No one must've loved you, probably cause you retarded, wow
You is just a kid like me who started yell rapping
Give it up nigga, your interaction is fail yapping

[Hook]
It's a long beach
It's a long beach
It's a long beach
It's a long beach
It's a long-, it's a long-, it's a long beach
It's a long beach
It's a long beach
It's a long beach
It's a long beach
It's a long-, it's a long-, it's a long beach
It's a long-, it's a long-, it's a long beach
It's a long beach
It's a long beach
(Oh nigga, you tell 'em)

MONDAY GUNDAY 2 Lyrics[Part 1]

I regret nothing
I regret nothing
I regret nothing

Why you like me hurt (Yuh)
Why you'd like to see me down
They made jesus hurt (Yuh)
They gave that nigga a crown
Covered him in dirt (Yuh)
Hid him back beneath the ground
Got up for one more round (Yuh)

Get up my nigga
Can't let you get wet up my nigga
Don't forget to breathe
Forget to breathe
And you might end up on yo knees
But you got nobody to please

Focus on gain
Don't walk around looking to pain
Don't walk around like you the devil

'Cause niggas like me ain't the one you should meddle with
I got too much going for me to settle bitch
I'll hit that pedal quick
Hit you with metal ditch
All of it burn it like it was a kettle or THC peddle

I have depression
That is my honest confession

If I'm gonna die anyway
Then I'd rather fight you any day then let you call me gay
Get away without running your fade
Hit yo gut like a blade
Outta muscle it made
Wanna tussle I bathe
In my own blood and my sweat and my tears
I won't let peers in my circle get near
I play Nirvana and dress really weird
Makes up for how I got nobody dear
Why you ignoring yourself nigga
It don't matter if yo daddy missing
Momma tripping
Partner dissing you
Don't be a chicken dude
Ball up yo fist move into position
Hit him in rhythm
Don't care if he sitting
If he put a finger on me the I get him
I will not let him
My knuckle I fed him
As soon as it met him
I chuckle he yelling

Keep talking shit then I bust in yo jaw
Out came the principal out came the law
Ask everybody just what they had saw
Darkie was fighting and cussing and raw
Punish us equally even though he wouldn't speak to me
'Less he was trying to weaken me

I gotta keep it G
Shouldn't you punish a nigga for fighting but also his reasoning
Excellent seasoning!
Making our youth into pussies that can't tell a good from an evil thing
That's what you saying then?
Telling a nigga to kill himself
That is walking in and spraying them?

I run around no hope in sight (Yuh)
The ones that kill won't let us fight (Yuh)
The blood I spill took no ones life (Ayy)
You demons seem to want my rights (Yuh)

Should I bring the pipes? (Uh)
Take it in my own hands
No that isn't right (Yuh)
You ain't doing shite! (Yuh)

You ain't doing shit
Calling me white 'cause I ain't black enough to brighten up yo sight (Yuh)
Hateful people bite (Uh)

Narrower perspective than a mite
Or a detective with his glass upon the type
Trying to read without a light

They create the crazy with the rifle ducking
Plucking all the fruit before they ripe

POW!

Monday gunday
Monday run my fade
Keep the people in a haze

You're the kind subservient nigga we tryna raise
Color in the lines if you don't we got our ways

(Not very many people bothered me after that)
*Laughter*

[Part 2]

Yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh, yuh

*Laughter*

Yuh, yuh

​i can see clearly Lyrics[Intro]
Let us begin
Once upon a time, Darkie was camping in the forest
Have, probably having a really nice dream
And, um, the sun started to rise and he woke up to the sight of a beam of light coming through his tent
And uh, he couldn't wait to see what was outside

[Chorus]
I wish you saw me like you see you (See you, oh, oh, oh)
I wish you saw me like you see you, see me, see you
(And this is what he thought about)

[Verse]
I wish you could see that I'm a person too
I wish you could see that I am hurting too
On the attack, the ignorant see me and they see food
But I'll see them yack if it truly the last thing that I do
And they want that back, the power to place someone under rule
But all of that's crap, mm, but all of that's crap to mе
And all of that's crap
I can't see your face through all the shit you're talkin' to mе
Let's sit down and mix perspectives up and sip that smoothie
Hate will bring you down or bring you up if you move smoothly
I may get around and act a clown but you can't fool me
[Chorus]
I wish you saw me like you see you (Oh, oh, oh)
I wish you saw me like you see you, see me, see you

[Post-Chorus]
I wish you saw me
I wish you saw me at all
Saw us both the same
I wish you saw me the same

[Outro]
Ooh, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
I am outside right now and I see a hummingbird in the tree, oh
It flies away, how beautiful11Embed

SWAMP Lyrics[Intro]
Mayday, sewer flooding
Evacuate immediately
Mayday, sewer flooding
Evacuate immediately
(Get the fuck outta here!)
Boss, the gaskets blown
We're holding it back as long as we can

[Verse 1]
Every day
I wake up, my mind filled with stuff I can't say
Blackened muck and it backin' up in my brain
Stack and puff, like ain't that enough for my pain?
Actin' tough will not get the fuckin' swamp drained
[Bridge]
The swamp never drained (Drain)
The swamp never drained
The swamp never drained
​srettam yllaer gnihton taht dna yraropmet si gnihtyreve taht detpecca evah tub ,ytilaer siht ni ecalp ym detpecca evah I .htaed detpecca evah I
Hahahahaha
Hello, monkeys
Hahahahaha
Swamp (Hahaha), swamp
Yo' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Take me back to the back of the class, bitch, stand for the flag, salute
Take me back to the mass when my grandfather passed in the past and I'm on them pews
Afraid of the dark, I just left my brain at the park, aw shoot (Huh)
Fuck all the hate and the city and the state, you're doin' what they want you to
F-f-fuck the system, fuck division
Always hearing, never listen
Disappearin' from your vision
Fuck your laziness and reckless indecision
You are just a maggot on a mission (Faggot, pissin')
I don't give a fuck about a pussy nigga, bitch
I gotta get it, gotta get it, my nigga, to generate
Another nigga growin' bigger, the figure inseminated
Hella faded when I puff on the stick
The tar stickin' made of bigger shit that sit in the pit
I gotta spit it, gotta get it out, floodin' my skin
This shit build up, breakin' down the barrier quick
[Interlude]
I have allowed this shit to build up for too long
I have said nothing for too long
Yuh
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh (Alright, listen up you stupid sons of bitches)
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh

[Verse 3]
I'm tired of feelin' so depressed
Breathin' all this smoke into my chest
Everywhere I go, I make a mess
I don't wanna end up like the rest
Anything can end up on the test
Always been a mission to take those
The same niggas wishing you the best
Never wanna see a nigga blow
Never wanna pull up to a show
Do not hit my motherfuckin' phone
I got psilocybin in my dome
I know what you're hiding, what you on
Mouth breathing, clout seizing, couch sleeping
Piece of fucking garbage, nigga
Stop breeding, stop fucking, stop sucking
Stop all that for starters, nigga
Niggas doin' punk shit for likes
You ain't nothin' like the punk shit you like
Cut yourself and put your hair in spikes
Niggas playin' dress up, like some dykes
Oh, does that offend a bit? Right
Do not get it motherfuckin' twisted
I don't give a fuck if you tight
And I'ma do my business from a distance
Rappers talkin' shit about the right
But they the ones that's givin' to the system
Benefittin' from it when we fight
The government will never fuckin' listen
I ain't gonna stand here and cap
I ain't gonna stand here and lie
Yo' favorite rapper lying when he rap
Yo' favorite rapper liable to die
Yo' favorite rapper take it in the back
Feeding, givin' money for attention
Designer drip, blowin' hella racks
Ain't nobody focused on ascension
Everyone a hypocrite, facts
I am just a maggot on a mission
I ain't cuttin' anybody slack
The rapper is the new politician (Yeah, huh)
The rapper is the new democrat
Republican, better remember that
We always talk about 'bout where we are never at (Huh)
The rapper is the new Bill Clinton
Lookin' for an evil bitch, Hillary
Baby blood inside a goblet filling me
Military coppin' mad artillery
Drain the swamp (Huh)
Oh really, nigga? But I thought I did
These other sucker niggas pray to God I got a problem
Thought I'd solve it with a thought I'm in
I woke up today (Goo-Good morning), I just wanna go back to sleep
Liked it better when I couldn't even tell you motherfuckers had a back to me
[Outro]
What's the matter, you scared? (Huh)
I can't see anything
Are you over here?
Hello?
Hello?12Embed
