Star Shopping Lyrics[Verse]
Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces
[Chorus]
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason1.4KEmbed

Save That Shit Lyrics[Intro]

Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit

Awful Things Lyrics[Intro: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
You like attention, I find it obvious
She makes it obvious for me
She feels the tension
It's just the two of us, it's just the two of us, tonight
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I get it, girl
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I'm not the one

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
Don't you turn your back on me
Let your teardrops fall on me
Speeding away, the city in the rearview
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
GothBoi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down till there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies, and gems
You can have all of them

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me161Embed

I can see it in your eyes, that you need it right now
That you need it right now
That you wanna get out

Smokin' on this loud, woah

Girl, you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss, then we fuckin', I just can't get enough
Put it on me, that's the best part, baby, the trust
Trust me, I got nothin' for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie 'til the Sun came up
All the places that you took me, no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me, now they on my nuts83Embed

Oh, Skedda!

She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately

​hellboy Lyrics[Intro]
Can this be him?
The one I have waited centuries to see?
How strange
So far from his path that I barely see the promise of glory
Can this be him, this Hellboy?

[Chorus]
You don't even know what I've been through (I've been through)
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Ya bitch do)

Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you." (I miss you)
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you

Leave me to bleed, I know I got you on your knees
But something keeps on tellin' me
It keeps on tellin' me
"Peep, leave it alone, I'm good on my own."
Mama miss me at home, but I'm good on my own
Baby, I'm cold, back on the road
Show after show, fuckin' ho' after ho'
I swear it gets so lonely sometimes
Please, just hold me one time
Fuck these hoes and fuck life

You're the same as my ex, fuck you (Damn, ayy)

​the way i see things Lyrics[Verse]
I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So, let's laugh a little before I'm gone
I’ve been dreamin' of this shit for a while now
Got me high now
She don't love me, but she's singin' my songs (Oh, no)
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back, and a bullet in my brain
I’m clinically insane
Walkin' home alone, I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it gettin' high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now, I'm so high, I be fuckin' with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the mornin' with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me
[Chorus]
Runnin' away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you, no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things163Embed

Life is Beautiful Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Working every day, now you're bleeding through your cuticles
Passing through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryin' to keep your cool at your grandfather's funeral
Finding out eventually the feeling wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothing like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they're sayin' it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fucking kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning, now you doing the impossible
Find out what's important, now you're feeling philosophical
When I die, I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical

[Verse 3]
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I try suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

[Outro]
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful177Embed

And when it comes clear, I will be waiting right here
Just tell me if you need me and I will meet you right there

Whip it like a Nascar, I can see the time pass
Feel like I'm in high school, fuckin' me in gym class

You was fuckin' with me way before I even wrote raps

But it's all good 'cause I let her spend my money, though
Playboy bunny, though, shawty look like a pornstar
I know she love me 'cause she fuck me in her sports car

Drop top, smokin' thrax, lookin' at the stars
Gettin' high, takin' bars 'til we on Mars

Now I'm lookin' at my phone, should I text you?
I just wanna sex you, I just wanna bless you
Baby, I'm a priest in the underworld, guess who

​feelz ♡ Lyrics[Intro]
(Cowabunga, dude!)

[Chorus]
I love you to the summer and back, it's not the winter
But you've frozen my heart, and got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back, the love I give her
Is kinda creepy, but fuck it, she orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone, my little mama
Is mad at me at the moment, know she's such a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'

[Verse]
I will always be here for you, and when I'm dyin'
I pray to a higher power, next to you is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor? I'm feelin' naughty
I wish to explore your features, secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice, my only option
Watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine, I'll fuckin' kill you
Take you out to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find, my little angel
In your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got nowhere to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got till I'm gone, and that's a promise
Unless you didn't want it, then for you I'd be dishonest
[Chorus]
I love you to the summer and back, it's not the winter
But you've frozen my heart, and got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back, the love I give her
Is kinda creepy, but fuck it, she orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone, my little mama
Is mad at me at the moment, know she's such a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'73Embed

​lil jeep Lyrics[Chorus]
I remember when you used to hold my hand
Now you actin' like a ghost, girl
Live forever with a smile stuck on your face
You think he know you, but I know you the most, girl
You will never find another one just like me
Long nights, gettin' high on the coast, girl
Two weeks and I still got the same old jeans on
Never got a girl when I need one

[Post-Chorus]
I see your face when I look out the window
I think about her every time that I sniff blow
If you love me, hit me up on the flip phone (Yeah, prr)
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know
[Bridge]
I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I remember when you used to hold my hand
Now you actin' like a ghost, girl
Live forever with a smile stuck on your face
You think he know you, but I know you the most, girl
You will never find another one just like me
Long nights, gettin' high on the coast, girl
Two weeks and I still got the same old jeans on
Never got a girl when I need one

[Post-Chorus]
I see your face when I look out the window
I think about her every time that I sniff blow
If you love me, hit me up on the flip phone (Yeah, prr)
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know

[Outro]
I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know

​praying to the sky Lyrics[Intro]
Nah

[Chorus]
You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice (Yeah), nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (Tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fuckin' life (Fuckin' life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fuckin' right (Wrong)
In your thong, smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (Hey, uh, hey)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch, I'm tatted out my shirt, so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt, then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm prayin' to the sky, I don't even know why, ayy
[Verse]
Oh, I don't think I can take this anymore
No, washin' the blood from my wrist on the floor
Oh, fuck, what you talkin' 'bout? My shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole
For eternity, so they can reap what they sow (Shit)
Oh, I don't think I can do nothin' but flow
No, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Oh, I don't know why you in love with me, ho
I keep them felonies up in my coat
Up in the zone, I'm all on my own

[Chorus]
You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice (Yeah), nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (Tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fuckin' life (Fuckin' life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fuckin' right (Wrong)
In your thong, smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (Hey, uh, hey)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch, I'm tatted out my shirt, so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt, then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm prayin' to the sky, I don't even know why, ayy84Embed

16 Lines Lyrics[Intro]
16 lines-
Of blow and I'm fine
You're wastin' your time, wastin' your time
Please don't cry

[Chorus]
16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones, but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wastin' your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind
I been on my own since age nine
16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones, but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wastin' your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind
I been on my own since age nine
[Verse]
I been on my own for two nights
I been in my zone, I've been high
Now she wonder why do I lie
I can't tell my wrongs from my rights

[Bridge]
Is anybody out there? (Is anybody out there?)
Can anybody hear me? (Can anybody hear me?)
I hate it when you fake care (I hate it when you fake care)
Girl, I know you hear me (Girl, I know you hear me)
Is anybody out there? (Is anybody out there?)
Can anybody hear me? (Can anybody hear me?)
I hate it when you fake care (Fake care)
Girl, I know you hear me (Hear me)

[Chorus]
16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones, but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wastin' your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind
I been on my own since age nine
[Outro]
Is anybody out there? (Is anybody out there?)
Can anybody hear me? (Can anybody hear me?)
I hate it when you fake care (I hate it when you fake care)
Girl, I know you hear me (Hear me)105Embed

​​​​haunt u Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, I love you, my dear
But I'm goin', I'm gone

[Verse]
My time is here and I'm makin' it clear
Oh, I love you, my dear
But I'm goin', I'm gone
I might come back when the Benz all black
Ten racks on my lap
If I don't relapse and I stay strong
I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die, I'ma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time, but I never wanna do that again
Nothin' worse than losin' a friend
And the feelin' you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waitin' for a wave and I'll drown
Satan letting me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby, I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free, all you gonna get from me
Little bit of love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it all105Embed
