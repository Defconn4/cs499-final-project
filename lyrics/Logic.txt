1-800-273-8255 Lyrics[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine
[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why
[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now
[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore818Embed

Homicide Lyrics[Intro: Smokey Legendary, Logic & Both]
Son, you know why you the greatest alive?
Why, Dad?
Because you came out of my balls, nigga
Hahahahahaha
(Roof!)

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies
[Verse 1: Logic]
I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school "He's cool, he's not" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika-chika
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady
[Verse 2: Logic]
There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (Do-do-do) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked
You gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chika-chika-chika-chika
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said "Rover" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm 'bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

[Outro: Chris D'Elia]
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flamminababbitapannitajampkin
Dammit, a can of pada-739Embed

Gang Related Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause
Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug
Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night it's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Wakin' up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat like that
Guarantee you itâ€™s a wrap
Finna put you on your back like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Gotta leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop
â€˜Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches
And the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even gotta drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related
[Break: News Report Sample]
Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg, where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight
[Verse 2]
Livin' life like this
Hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it I'ma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about what I pray about
Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the *gunshots* in the dead of night
Sellin' crack to my own pops
Pushin' this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and donâ€™t give a fuck
Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and donâ€™t give a fuck
[Pause] â€” Get down or lay down
Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given
Anybody thatâ€™s ridin' with me, Iâ€™m ridin' with 'em
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em
And hit 'em with the venom
Ainâ€™t no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it, already been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang related653Embed

Ayy, bitch, I've been goin' and goin' like the Energizer
Yeah, I'm supplyin' the wood like Elijah
In the cut, smokin' on indica
Might fuck around and compartmentalize ya
They say, they say life is a bitch
And if that is the case then I'm finna surprise her
No, I am not an advisor, but I do advise ya
To pay attention, never need to mention
I'm that motherfucker bustin' heads
Finna push it to the ledge
Yeah, I been smokin' my meds
Ain't got no love for the feds
Can't let fame go to yo' head
Fuck with me, watch where you tread
I'm finna kill it instead
I'm finna, I'm finna, I'm finna
I will, I will, do it like I never done it
And I wanna run it and I wanna keep it goin' and goin'
Like infinity, be the only entity to ever rip it apart
From the start like this, from the heart like this
Finna murder it, a million miles a minute, no nitrous
Doin' righteous
I-I been, I-I-I been down this road before
Everybody think that they do but they don't
Swear to God that they would but they won't
Spittin' riddles in the middle of a past-time
Me in my mind, feelin' divine, like yeah
Finna get it like yeahâ€”yeah
Like yeah, like yeah (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
I done made 20 million dollars (Preach)
I don't flex to be acknowledged (Preach)
At this point it's common knowledge (Preach)
All you haters been abolished (Preach)
You in the club throwin' dollars, but I'm savin' mine so my kids go to college (Preach)
Or maybe whatever they wanna do (Preach)
Just as long as they never say (Preach)
"Daddy blew 20 million dollars (Ayy)
He had to flex to be acknowledged (Ayy)
He in the club throwin' dollars
And now cannot afford to send me to college (Ayy)
Daddy just wanna be loved
Just like everybody wanna be accepted (Ayy)
But somehow he had neglected
Me and my momma for all of this rap shit" (Ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that shit (Ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that
[Verse 2]
Who you know dropped an album
Back to back to back to back to back to back again?
I'm back again to snap again
And goddamnit, it ain't no other way around it
Yeah, it's happenin', 'cause I've been livin' in a world on my own
Leave me alone, I'm in the zone
Where I've been prone to destroy shit
You cannot avoid this, wack mothafuckas have annoyed this
Yes, you know I enjoy this
Preach, mothafuckin' preach
Yeah, I'm tryna reach everybody in the streets
Writin' words to the beats
Each one teach one, yeah, I'm tryna reach one
Who the beast one?
That be me, on the top to the East one
Tell me how you really wanna do it right now, time to murder this
Shout out everybody, no fuckin' around, ain't heard of this
Heard of us, we ain't goin' nowhere, it's a herd of us
Hold up, roll up

[Verse 3]
Levitated like I'm David Blaine
Livin' a dream like I'm David Aames
Talk all you want, we are not the same
Step in the spot, now they know the name
Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry
If that ain't a sign of the times
Then I don't know what is, man this shit is scary
'Cause bitch, I've been blowin' up like C-4
And I'm 3 for 3 like a free throw
Anybody hatin' on the boy, take a step back and then deep-throat
Now my phone blowin' up like ring
Like ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!
That Kevin Durant, I'm a champion
Check the numbers, I'm a champion
Can't sleep on the boy anymore
But the haters that love to hate gon' pop an Ambien
Star Lord, champion
Know the name, now they know the alias, that's for sure

Everybody Lyrics[Intro]
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh, itâ€™s like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show 'em how to act
I'ma show 'em how to act

[Verse 1]
Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts
[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Verse 2]
I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real, I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didnâ€™t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts
[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Outro]
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh, it's like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now

[Chorus]
Work so fucking much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone (I'm lovin' it!)
People calling me, askin' me for money, man (Uh)
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, livin' how I'm livin', fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, drivin' through the sticks
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waitin' forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothin' at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard
Uh, but it's hard
[Chorus]
Uh, work so fuckin' much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People callin' me, askin' me for money, man
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 2]
God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm livin' divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out (And I'm dripped out)
Right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wonderin', "How so?"
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be askin' us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never actin' up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasin' fame, chasin' glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury
[Chorus]
Work so fuckin' much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People callin' me, askin' me for money, man
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone
[Verse 3]
(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is yo' sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like Iâ€™m just not yo' sister at allâ€”all
Uh, Iâ€™m sorry for callin' and bawlin', Iâ€™m all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know Iâ€™m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he ainâ€™t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure
[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain'tâ€”you ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me
[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you donâ€™t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya. Hm-hm, I love you, son, bye482Embed

Nikki Lyrics[Verse]
I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm just not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)
Nikki baby, I love you but now I gotta go
'Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for (Paying for)
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black (My lungs black)
Tell me where you been Jack (Been Jack)
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first
Me and you together, swear to God that's all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn, took me as a young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you (Taste you)
Nothing can replace you (Replace you)
I wish I could erase you, youâ€™re everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask whatâ€™s wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I'm a king, you're my Coretta
But lately, I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)
[Break]
Slave for theâ€”
Said, I'm a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)
Been a slave for ya
I'm a muthafuckin' slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)
Nikki, Nikki, slave for ya
I'm a slave for ya Nikki
I'm a muthafuckin' slave for ya

Black SpiderMan Lyrics[Intro]
Jesus, Black Jesus
Jesus, Black Jesus

[Chorus]
I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I donâ€™t belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I donâ€™t know what's up
What's up, what's up
Yeah, yeah
Ayy
[Verse]
I ainâ€™t here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
Iâ€™m just here to spread the clues
Iâ€™m just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I ainâ€™t ashamed to be white
I ainâ€™t ashamed to be Black
I ainâ€™t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And Iâ€™m not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and donâ€™t ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know Iâ€™m good
Sometimes Iâ€™m misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you donâ€™t wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I donâ€™t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I donâ€™t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact Iâ€™m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact Iâ€™m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man Iâ€™ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, Iâ€™m black and proud
Iâ€™m just as white as that Mona Lisa
Iâ€™m just as black as my cousin Keisha
Iâ€™m biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead
Glover instead
Like what's up
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more
[Chorus]
I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I donâ€™t belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I donâ€™t know what's up
What's up, what's up

You know everything is alright
You know everything is al-

[Verse 1: Logic]
Just ride with a mothafucka
Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucka, hold me down
Chillin', In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, rockin' Adidas
With a seÃ±orita when she sippin' liquor by the liter
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino
He know we be in the casino, lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito
Whenever I step on the beat, ho
Like a killer on the creep slow
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though, uh
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with a sawed-off
Blowin' up like a Molotov
This is war, everybody, ain't no reason I'ma call it off
Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright
In the studio every day
So you know this shit about to be a busy night
Everything is al-, everything is alright

It's Finally Famous over everything
RattPack gang

Oh my God, they plottin' and schemin'
Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'
They tryna take my blessings away
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed every day
And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got Champagne problems, and I order more
My wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician (Good, yeah)
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician (Good)
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up (Uh-huh)
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap-dap me up
Hype nigga, back-back-back it up (Woah)
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop (Stop)
That's the type of shit I boycott
Yellin' fuck the 5-0, state troops
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts
I got these good girls hoin' out
Tell me what the fuck you know about (What?)
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know about
Then they throw you in the game
And you mothafuckin' blow it out
Now everything is alright

Whippin' through Gotham
Hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off 'em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain
But I be killin' 'cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back, it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novella
Hit you with a Beretta, get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me, prolly wanna fight me
But I just keep the peace, no need to keep a piece
I keep my enemies on a leash, capiche?
And keep it real for the people I reach433Embed

[Intro]
All day (All day), everyday (Everyday)
We was on that block until we made a way (We made a way)
Day to day, man that's the only way (Only way)
They gon' know my name until it fade away
[Chorus]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fadeâ€”
(Way, way, way), uh, fade away
Uh, they gon' know my name until it fade away
(Okay, okay)

[Verse 1]
I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit I run that
Motherfucker this far from a comeback, if one of us fall then we run back
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my kin, gotta get my son back
Cause when they coming through that system don't give a fuck about you (You, you, you)
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday
Driving to work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day
I know, I'ma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce
Never regretted, the second I said it I feel like I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder ya predicate, bitch I'm ahead of it, yeah
Yes I'ma die but I donâ€™t wonder why in the hell I'ma ride in the dead of it, yeah
I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable
Okay-kay, hold up let me say yes I fade away

[Chorus]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade aâ€” uh
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2]
Tell me what I wouldn't wanna give for a life like this, arm and a leg quite like this
Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this
I might just, might just, I don't know
Reinvention, that's my intention
Want so much more than this third-dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture
No metaphor, Iâ€™m being real with ya
But it will hit ya like, "goddamn!"
Going HAM, full of all of them
In a spaceship, Iâ€™m in another system
So futuristic, on another mission
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my lifeâ€”no inhibition, life to death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when it's out the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'ma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'ma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

[Chorus (Extended)]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fadeâ€”
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fadeâ€”
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

44 Bars Lyrics[Intro]
If you deal with war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap)

[Verse]
Yeah, in London talkin' to rhÃªtorÃ­k 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppetto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rareâ€”I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, "'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne

Come some more into my sight...119Embed

5AM Lyrics[Intro]
Alright
Seen a lot of shit (Yeah)
Seen a lot of shit

[Verse 1]
I seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corner selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door while gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me, goddamn, you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't into fairy tales, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you got a fucking problem, bitch, I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill 'em with kindness, yeah, we leave â€˜em deceased
And tell it like it is so now you got it, capiche? Homie, what up?
[Chorus]
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down

[Verse 2]
I hope you live a long life hatin'
Now watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
RattPack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make it, shooting for the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, whoa
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it RattPack 'til the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mind-state celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they mama's
I rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic
[Chorus]
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down

Keanu Reeves Lyrics[Intro]

[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve

[Verse 1]
At the Garden, sitting courtside, look around like, "Oh my God"
I just sold this motherfucker out, I ain't even try
I ain't one to floss, but I got plaques, run it back
Once I touch down, I go deep like a running back
Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint
Played the beat then wrote that joint
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint
Fuck Illuminati, that boy 6ix got my back
6ix made this beat, 6ix bring the heat you got on repeat
Word on the street
Can't no one compete, I'm spectacular
That boy got the sauce on the RAGÃš-lar
I don't play no games 'less we talkin' Fortnite
Finally knew I made it, sittin' at the red light
When them soccer moms pull up in they van while I ride
Like, "Oh my God, children, it's the 1-800 guy"
But my doors suicide, yeah, I'm too alive
Bitch, I have arrived, everybody know I'm one hell of a guy
I ain't tryna fuck your girl, I'm tryna fuck your mama
Fuck the drama, bank account got a extra comma
Yeah, they sweat me like the sauna
Red carpet in my own merch, like that shit is designer
Did you know I'm mixed like Obama?
It ain't a project if Logic ain't talkin' 'bout being biracial
Bicoastal, I'm platinum, go postal, I'm snappin'
Yeah, you know Bobby, but prolly' only know my new shit
That trap shit, that cool shit, but they all know that fool spit
[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you know you made it when they make a meme for ya
Haters that never made it, I'm livin' the dream for ya
Roll up, grab the kush and then roll up
Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up
You know what I do, not who coming through
How 'bout you?
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school
I don't give a damn that I'm famous
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, "No, I don't wanna pay my bills"
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet
Got five degrees and six figures in debt
Follow your dreams ho, follow yourâ€” follow yourâ€”, uh
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me
PLP, I think that is the recipe
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood
[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe

Flexicution Lyrics[Chorus: Logic]
Yeah
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad

This-this-this-this-this the type of shit they said they really wanted
So I gave them this right here, now go get blunted
Check my last album, all y'all know I run it
Flipped the script just 'cause I could and fucking stunted
This-this-this-this-this the type of shit my life is all about
Check the Forbes list, you know I'm ballin' out
They say, "Logic, you too humble, boy, just let it out"
Fuck 'em all then, I'ma dead it now
Like oh, I think I know, I think I know
This flow, this super flow, out of control
Like whoa, this shit like whoa, I think I know
Like whoa, like, like whoa, like, like, like...
[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
This that flexicution

[Verse 2: Logic]
Hold on, let me bring it back
Everybody know I'm bringing the facts
And they wonder why I got it like that
'Cause I put everything right on the track
And you know I'ma fuck around and let it go
I been living like woah, I been living, you already know
And these motherfuckers wanna take up on every mistake
And I'm showing where I'm going
And I'm knowing what I'm doing, intuition never switching
On a mission, motherfucker, why is you bitching? Why is you bitching?
Like God damn, I'm like (Oh God)
Hold up, wait a minute, they ain't ready for the hook
It's another day, another book
I feel like Indiana in Atlanta, hotter than Havana
Coming with the stamina
Bitch, put down your camera, and live in the moment
This shit right here, everybody gon' want it, so what up witâ€™ it?
Any and everybody talk about the boy changing
Y'all can just shut up witâ€™ it 'cause I know
Ain't none of y'all getting the flow, boy...

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
It's been a hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)
Hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)

That I've been M.I.A, but I was tied up

Ballin Lyrics[Verse 1: Logic]
Okay
It's RattPack 'til my pulse flat, we keep it real, no false rap
I got four cards and they all black, got four broads and they all that
We call that ballin', doin' this is my callin'
Flow is so appallin', my phone off and she callin', I'm like, "Yeah
What it do?" Penthouse, man, what a view
Fall back, 'cause I'm coming through with my whole team, they coming too
That's real, too real, motherfucker, tell me how you feel
I'm too good for my own good, I won't leak the album, I'll let it spill
Number one, bitch, I bet it will, do the numbers I said it will
I played the game and I'm still the same and I never changed just to get a deal

[Chorus: Logic]
Bitch, I'm ballin'
Ballin', I came from nuttin' to somethin'
Like it's nuttin', yeah, you know I done it, now there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know
[Verse 2: Logic]
I'ma live life 'til I overdose while they sleepin' on me, that's comatose
I went mainstream with my main team, you just mad as fuck, you ain't come close
And your next girl is my ex-girl, she fine as hell, but she a mess girl
All I do is rhyme, I got no time, so I can't reply to your text, girl
Bitch, I'm back again and I run it, always gotta keep it one-hunnid
All of y'all know y'all want it, turn it up and get blunted
I'm like, "Fuck the money, fuck the fame," I came here to fuck up the game
Gon' get it, I'm feelin' myself, fresh to death, bitch, I'm killin' myself; I'm gone
We burnin' it up, step in the building, we turnin' it up
Talkin' that shit, but they never admit when I step to the mic I be murderin' it
And we livin' real good, mainstream, but it's still good
I got raw shit, I got real shit, but right now it's time for that feel good
We call that ballin', doin' this is my callin'
Flow is so appallin', my phone off and she callin', I'm like, "Yeah
What it do?" Penthouse, man, what a view
Fall back, 'cause I'm coming through with my whole team, they coming too, that's

I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know
[Verse 3: Shy Grey]
Yeah
You know that we ballin', we been goin' all-in
Hold on, let me slow it down so y'all get the shit
These haters talk, but I don't give a shit
Got models, bottles, and the piff is lit
But we ballin', kinda like Spalding and Rawlings
On the road to riches never stallin'
Got your girl all up all on my nuts, boy
She do it with joy, no almonds, ugh
Living life to perfection, V.I.P., that's the section
Presidential watch, presidential suites
You would think we held an election
It go Logic first, then I'm up next
I do not converse, I just cut checks
I do not rehearse, I just drop the verse
I need to cop a hearse, 'cause I'm fresh to death
I bet you never seen so much designer
Never seen a nigga with a bitch that's finer
Boy, I stunt when I ain't even tryna
Swaggin' is nice, but first I'ma rhymer
And I rep Maryland, home of the Terrapins
Say you spit crack, homie, we spit that heroin
Bring it right to your front door like I'm carolin'
Standing next to me would be so embarrassin', yeah, we be
[Chorus: Logic]
Ballin', ballin'
I came from nuttin' to somethin'
Like it's nuttin', yeah, you know I done it, now there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they never go

Soul Food Lyrics[Verse 1]
Goddamn, goddamn, conversations with legends
Crazy how one day yo' idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus, money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe than think down and leave us
The baby cryin'
Crack cookin' where my sister be fryin' soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her assâ€”I'll kill him, I'll kill him
I'll motherfuckin' kill him, I said, I really want to kill himâ€”but I can't
'Cause if I do, po-po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it? I grip the mic and then kill itâ€”okay, I'm gone
As memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin', sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little Bobby, just a youngin', skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the sto'
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my do'
Can't take no mo', mama on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I'm from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon
Catch me rollin' with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, Sub Zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I'm De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me, best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like "Thriller"
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We don't do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slingin' like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does (Logic)
Yeah
[Break: Thalia]
Hip-hop

[Chorus]
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer, even though heaven sent him, uh
[Verse 2]
See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersin' these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energyâ€”I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number oneâ€”I better be
Bitch, I said, "I bet I be."
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me, how is they gon' remember me?
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just 'cause I was different
Just 'cause I was doing what I love?
And the fans say they love you, but they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hunnid
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry 'bout bitches and gettin' blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference: I'm stronger and better from when I begun
So when people that never knew me, they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged, I just stop (I just stop)
And do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions, that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending, one must understand the prequel, uh
[Chorus]
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer even though heaven sent him
Spit it like Holy water, prophetically repent 'em
Then we gone279Embed

All I Do Lyrics[Intro]
Ayo, shout out to Black Diamond
I got them Nikes on my feet as we speak, homie
Yeah
Shout out to Mac Miller

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind (Sinatra)
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
[Verse 1]
Ugh, yeah
My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my grind
And at this moment in time, Iâ€™m on a road when I write this rhyme
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while heâ€™s passed out
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out, oh my
Good god, you know we fly
Day dreaming out the window, watch how buildings pass me by
See I ainâ€™t signed but at this point in time
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl
All I do is rhyme and get money, thatâ€™s my repertoire
Holla at honeys, "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?"
Baby whatâ€™s the deal, have you ever heard of some shit so real?
(Cudi what up?)

[Refrain]
Itâ€™s going down
Feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down
While the rest of the world just stare

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Al-al-al-all I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
[Verse 2]
Yeah
This is the joint that when you hear it you like, "Thatâ€™s my shit!"
Maybe at a house party while you getting lit
Or while you cruising 'round town riding in a whip
One thingâ€™s for sure, you better get all of your friends here
If a shorty like my music, then she a (Bobbysoxer)
Got a booty, know how to use it, homie, yes, I rocks her
The second I jump on a stage, Iâ€™m rocking it, ainâ€™t nobody stoppin' it
Whoever goes on after me, Iâ€™m sorry, you ainâ€™t topping it

[Refrain]
Itâ€™s going down
Feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down
While the rest of the world just stare

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Al-al-al-all I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
[Verse 3]
Ever since I was a youngin I knew Iâ€™d break in the game
While you worshiped other rappers that leave you less entertained
I was strategizing before the people knew my name
Fame what I shall attain on the road to success
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain
Yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito
I know we fight, but thatâ€™s poquito
Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Al-al-al-all I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?

Confessions of a Dangerous Mind Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't get no better, canâ€™t get no more cheddar
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta
I been made a livin', I'm never gonâ€™ give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that Iâ€™m fallinâ€™
The world think I'm ballinâ€™ and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who Iâ€™m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, "Fuck 'em all"?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?
[Chorus]
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know

[Interlude]
How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah

[Verse 2]
Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause "you'll never be Kenny"
"You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole"
"You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old," yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourâ€”'member, love yourself

Young Jesus Lyrics[Intro: Logic & Big Lenbo]
Yeah yeah, what up Bobby
Like goddamn, like goddamn
This that 9-5 shit right here
Take 'em back to the 90s!
Like goddamn, like goddamn
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo yo

[Verse 1: Logic]
Okay now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
Take 'em back to way back when, like Dennis the Menace
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant
Man, that's the definition of a life sentence
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce
'Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs, man that's pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain't a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it
I'm, forever alone in my mind (Yeah yeah)
See I'm a self-diagnosed hypochondriac
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
Yeah, I know that I'm livin' like I got it okay, yeah
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah

Over here, over here

Ayo, fuck all that, it's the fat young Jesus; flow prestigious
Stackin' money and playin' the field man like Regis
Better believe us or leave us
Grabbin' your bitch's cleavage like, "woo-hah"
I went from surveyin' to Super Saiyan slayin' the man
Bitches want an autograph
I sign them titties in crayon, like goddamn!
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
It's me and B-I, B-I, B-I-G L-N-B-O, L-N-B-O
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie
I'm unscannable, young cannibal, eat wack MCs like Hannibal
'Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal

Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious
The young Spiegel, interstellar with my retrieval
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval
I spit at it like a Beretta
You know I get better by givin' the people
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden
"The Return of the Jedi"
Bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do
This shit is (overdue, pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through)
The B-I-G L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio
Ay dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo
To hold a brother down like the white man
Fuck that nigga
Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff
Even in a pair of cuffs, know we always keep it real
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man
I'm just (301 reppin', second I step in Maryland)
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this
Throw a Molotov in your crib
And tell them bitches to bill us, we the illest
Finger fuck a critic
Shit is darker than "The Chronicles of Riddick"
Yes I did it, while they bit it, you know we got it
Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on121Embed

AfricAryaN Lyrics[Verse 1: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now Iâ€™m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me youâ€™ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people Iâ€™m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like Iâ€™m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it
[Refrain: Logic]
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming, trying to convince me Iâ€™m not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but lifeâ€™s not
And I'd be lying if I said I didnâ€™t care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe itâ€™s in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering whatâ€™s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

[Chorus: Logic]
(Oh my) Oh my
(Oh my) Like the white woman said oh my
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I donâ€™t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I canâ€™t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah
[Verse 3: Logic]
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Donâ€™t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
Iâ€™m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit donâ€™t make a dent in how Iâ€™m feeling
And yes Iâ€™m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when Iâ€™m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

[Refrain: Logic]
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(I said oh)

[Verse 4: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now Iâ€™m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me youâ€™ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people Iâ€™m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like Iâ€™m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
Like the white woman said oh my (Oh my)
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her

Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her

Everybody wonder why I get high
Cause I canâ€™t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my

[Bridge: Logic]
Sometimes I canâ€™t get you out of my mind
Baby, no I just canâ€™t find, I just canâ€™t find
Such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind, such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind
Sometimes everyday right on time
But right now in my mind
It feels like I'm living on borrowed time

[Verse 5: Logic]

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Donâ€™t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that youâ€™re not your salary. Youâ€™re not your house. Youâ€™re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone elseâ€™s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, weâ€™ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says weâ€™ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. Iâ€™m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one
[Outro: J. Cole]
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap
When it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, acceptance64Embed
