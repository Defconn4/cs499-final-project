1Night Lyrics[Hook]
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night (just for the night)

[Verse]
I know you want this for life
Fuck you so good you be calling out the Christ (oh my God)
Bottles of the Tech got it laid on ice
We spent four seasons at the Four Seasons twice
You be calling all your homegirls like "I'm his wife"
Hell nah, you trippin', reevaluate your life
I can't love no bitch, every single hoe is trife
I sip dirty Sprite just to get me through the night
But I need you there (I need you there)
Promise that I need you there
Ain't no other bitch gon' fuck me like you do, I swear
Put that on my gang I swear
I just can't put you on front street like you want I know
But baby you is not no hoe
And I put it on my gang I'm not no average joe (average joe)
It's Yachty from the block you know
[Hook]
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night25Embed

'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, ridin' 'round on boulders
Money sittin' up, it sits way above your shoulders
I was eatin' pork and rinds with a bitch from New York Times
I don't eat no pork and rinds but that bitch was mighty fine
I got gold all on my necklace, tatted up my arms
Now my mama think I'm reckless, got guns under my mattress
I was juggin since a youngin', free my older cousin Reesey
He from Hamilton not D.C, I rock N.Bs like I'm Gleeshy
Flip phone banging off the walls, Gucci on my drawers
Why the fuck you in these streets if you're scared of them four walls?
I was strokin' on your sister, she was callin' me her mister
She suck dick for a picture, it's Lil Yachty nice to meet you
I was juggin' off them stacks, countin' up them racks
Almost had a lifetime sentence, but I beat it, shout out to Pat!
Pat, that's my lawyer, he got me off them chargers
8 stacks for that boy, he took care of the boy

[Chorus]
Cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

Yacht Club Lyrics[Intro]
Earl on the beat

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Runnin' up bands, got my guap up
All the bad hoes wanna top us
Too many wild parties on the yacht
Me and Boat got kicked out the yacht club

[Verse: Lil Yachty & Juice WRLD]
Ayy, ayy, air it out
Pull up at your spot, and I air it out
Gang on the gas and it's very loud
Stop sayin' my name before you wear it out
I been sippin' lean, tryna slow me down
I need me a bitch that'll hold me down
Gang comin' strong, yeah we rollin' out
Throw a party like Rollin' Loud
Ayy, don't come unless she stay in focus
Soldiers at 10-4, sent your bitch the info
Feelin' real blessed with Juice, that's my kinfolk
Bless up, she tell me I'm a god, get on her knees for confession
Sent a vid to her nigga, had to teach a lesson
Me and Boat only want bad hoes in our section
Juice, why these pussy ass niggas always pressin'?
I don't know, let 'em talk, I'ma go get my Smith & Wesson
Blessed boys under 21, steady flexin'
I'm gettin' too rich, can't do flights with connections
.40 on my hip, I won't fight, bitch I'm reckless
Codeine what I sip, that shit come in straight from Texas
Reach for my chain, you'll get beat just like Nexus
Lamborghini dreams, but you still drive a Lexus
I'm a young king, I might fuck Alexis Texas
But I ain't on no Drake shit, I won't get her pregnant
Damn, young Juice WRLD, boy, you reckless
And I feel you, until I get her naked
When I get up in it, I might have to stay in
Well if she goin' like that, let's run a train then
Fuck, I think I nutted in her, I might need a playpen
And a stroller
How I get this deep? We rode her like a Rover
No games, but I XBOX control her
She do the gang like a nerd doin' homework
.40 in my pants, that bitch thought it was a boner
If I go broke, I'ma juug off Motorolas
But now I'm up in France, Lil Boat, that's my mans
We get the green and then we fly around like Peter Pan
That's cool, but I just thought 'bout somethin', wait
(What?)
This baby got your face
So fuck that lil' baby, boy's back to the place
Back to the trap, back to the gang
[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Lil Yachty]
Runnin' up bands, got my guap up (Runnin' the guap up)
All the bad hoes wanna top us (They wanna top us)
Too many wild parties on the yacht (Ohh-oh)
Me and Boat got kicked out the yacht club (Out the yacht club)

Intro Lyrics[Sample: Dory & Marlin]
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills
When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?
I don't know what you gotta do when life gets you down
Just keep swimming, just keep swimming
Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming
Dory, no singing
What do we do? We swim
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho, I love to swim

[Intro: Darnell Boat & Lil Boat]
Oh, okay. Where? Oh, you want me to sit right here? Where, look right there? Okay, okay, alright. I got it. Well... well, hello folks, Darnell Boat here. Today, I'ma tell you a little story about my two nephews, Lil Yachty and Lil Boat. Well, I don't know where to start. Look, here's Lil Boat now
Lil Boat!
Okay
[Verse 1: Lil Boat]
I've got these strange voices inside my head
Keep a stack and .380 beside my bed
Not to be cool, but in case they run up on me
If y'all bet on my fam, clutch with double on me
Went to school on a dirt road with black hoes and potholes
This shit was just then, this was four months
Late nights with gang on them store hunts
Loitering Walmart for pure fun
Look at me now, all of my classmates like, "Wow"
My teachers like, "Damn"
I remember I didn't have not a fan
Now I step out and Lil Boat is the man
Woah, this shit is surreal
Pockets stuffed in with blue bills
So much people trying to ask how it feels
But, nigga, I don't know
Everyday I ball like finger roll (woo!)
How'd you do it? Only God knows (oh!)
I want to know who's real until the time folds
People looking at Lil Boat with their hands out cause I'm wearing nicer clothes
I'ma stay down with the same niggas I came up with, that's the master plan
26 for a nigga hand, diamonds so cold you might need a fan (woo!)
I don't know who I am sometimes
I might rap a verse, I might sing a song
Came up overnight from one song
One night get her out the thong
Old heads hating on Boat
'Cause I'm young as fuck and I'm rich as hell
Pants low like I'm fresh in jail
But I've been out, motherfuck 12 (woo!)
[Interlude: Darnell Boat & Lil Yachty]
See, he's a little--he's a little bit more aggressive. Well, you know, as this story unfolds, and you know what I'm saying, as the story gets told, uh, I'll tell you a little bit more about Yachty. He's a little bit nicer. Let's call him
Hello? Hello?
[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Oh, oh, ohhh
Hello Boat, it's so nice to meet you
I'm so glad you came
Hello, hello
What's poppin'? It's Lil Yachty, I'm in the party
I need three thotties to come suck on my posse
What's poppin'? Woah
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Oh, hello
Welcome to my life

The fur on my shoulder mink, tell me what Hov would think

And I rock a sew-in weave (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
I run it, I run it, I relay the win
They talkin', they talkin', I'm takin' it in

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Boat boy just copped him some diamonds
She gon' suck my dick 'cause she like how I'm rhyming, it's all about timing
Got 22 bitches on standby, they fuck when I say so
Can't talk till my case closed
I'm hot like a pepper
Don't ash in my whip, bitch, it's basketball leather
Which nigga you rather? It better be me
Maison Margiela just for my black tee
Can't fuck with these niggas and all they rap beef
Got a Tec for a hundred, I'm feeling like money
My mouth looking sunny
These niggas look funny, so I keep the chop
I'm new and these niggas hopin' that I flop
I'mm flop in that pussy, it better be gushy, it better be hairless
Me and Kpreme beat your ass with our bare fists
When I get on, I'ma fuck me a Heiress
[Verse 2: BigBruthaChubba]
24 karat that'll fuck up my teeth
Pussy so wet that it fuck up the sheets
Catch me posted right there on the street
Pocket rocket right under the seat
Wish a pussy nigga would try me
In the kitchen whipping up the heat
Catch Purpp, get his ass beat
Smoking purp and then I ash it
50 band jugg, then I cash it
Fucking your hoe, then I pass it
Purple and lean, that my passion
Make it disappear like it's magic
Don't come to the 6 where it's tragic
Bricks wrapped up in elastic
In Europe with a bad bitch
And all we smoke is that cabbage

[Verse 3: Byou]
I'ma hot box in the drop top
Now the coupe look like a crock pot
Old school cubes in my ear
Damn, they looking like Macintosh
Flyer than an albatross
Rims chopped like applesauce
I don't pay the pussy what it cost
Diamonds look like tear drops
Play with squares like hop scotch
Rims so above the rim
No And1, but anyone of you niggas cross me, I'm up in it
Dump in it, huh?
I'ma catch a body like a cheerleader
I'ma die fly like Aaliyah
R.I.P., I'll see ya when I see ya
40 thousand dollars on the coat
It ain't even cold, I'ma call PETA
Whip it up with the eggbeater
Whole band on one sneaker
Another band on the other shoe l-l-like a nigga on house arrest
Chop the hit, you decompress, raising bars like bench press
Had to get the shit up off my chest, hey, hey
[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
Yuh, ayy, woah, damn, ayy, yuh, ayy

[Verse 4: Lil Yachty]
Had to get this shit up off my chest
Sendin' shots, you might need a vest
26 for a nigga neck
Water diamonds jeweler straight from Fiji
When I'm on my money, I look like a tiki
If you got a problem, nigga, don't you tweet me
I'm a real nigga, Lil Boat don't do Hilfiger
15 hundred for a still picture
Saint Laurent, nigga, these ain't Jordans
Crib fill of clothes like I'm hoarding
In the air while you niggas boarding
If the cake right, I'ma stick a fork in
[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Hahaha
That damn Lil Boat, he's something else, I tell you
Yeah, that DigitalNas something else, too
Well, I guess, uh, we gon' go holla at Yachty a little bit
He's, uh, he's-he's more emotional, you'll-you'll see what I'm talking about12Embed

Up Next 3 Lyrics[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, Chris Fresh, Lil Boat, Chris Fresh, Lil Boat
Yeah, and I'm tired of all you pussy ass niggas hatin' on Boat 'cause y'all see that nigga shinin', y'all see that nigga stuntin', y'all see that nigga up next, nigga
Fuck y'all niggas, uh

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Bitch, I'm the realest you've ever seen
And my new bitch, she a model from Africa
Any fine bitch with an ass, boy I'm after ya
22 diamonds, they shine like a brand new dime that you flip for a bet
Pussy nigga got behind the wheel and tried to race with Boat, well that's a cruise for a wreck
Stay with the Tec, gotta check on my neck
I need eight for a show
Brother locked up for the blow
Fuck you pussies, bitch, I skipped bein' rookie
What you want a cookie 'cause you got connect?
Nigga play hooky when they see it's Boat time
Ice on my wrist got you thinkin' it's cold time
Dunk on that bitch make you lean on your shoulder
Tripled my views now you thinkin' it's over
Skirt-skirt that Rover I spent a whole six up in Dover
Margiela my collar, I look like my father
Why'd u even bother? I'm richer I'm better
26 shit, I dropped it on my sweater
Just cause it's real leather, Versace my feathers
King sized set with the pillows
Dick in her pussy, she call me her hero
Dick in her mouth like a motherfuckin' churro
Knot so fat like a fuckin' burrito
Shout out taketa her pussy much sweeter
I lick it then stick it
Then kick it right on to my brother
Never fuck none of these hoes without rubbers
Bitch I'm so fly I can float on a cover
Now I see why you mad, cause I made it over night
And your bitch love Boat, now I see you wanna fight
And I just cannot help it because she think that I'm right
And she don't like you cause your music not excitin'
[Interlude: G Herbo]
808 Mafia
Ayy, Lil Boat, QC, what up?
150 DT, gang-gang, gang-gang, gang-gang, aye

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Bitch it's G Herbo, swervin' so much
Watch them start callin' me Swervo
In the M6 two door drop with the turbo
Engine from Russia, my Balmains for Bergdorf
My lil' ho from Merlow
Killas like Marlo
Come to your block, shoot it up with no sorrows
Still ride with Glocks and them chops over lanos
Let off them shells have you duckin' your taco and come back tomorrow
Maison Like Capo, Rollie a Bimmer, my bracelet a Tahoe
Riding an i8s in a race through Chicago
Remember I used to rock Echo and Pac on that Balmain where I go
Blunts full of posto
Remember I used to get free bands like Rocko
Got a white bitch snortin' lines, they El Chapo
Loadin' up .30's and countin' up guapo get top in my auto
Oops, I mean mobile, on the way home to my house in Herbo Hills
Remember them nights I was servin' with no deals
Lil' bro on Ess, know he lurkin', he gon' kill, rollin' off four pills
My life is so trill, I made a name off my block like I'm O'Neal
Get face to face with them cops and I don't squeal
Snitch did a bid but he would've did more years
Niggas a ho still
Wake up, get more bills
Rich with my squad in Chiraq like I'm Bo Deal
While in Miami we ridin' on four wheels
Block 100 deep, got the opps hidin' for years
Pop out, go trill
Glock color oatmeal
Know what I mean, bitch it's brown, it ain't no steel
Ridin', we lurkin', you better keep your steel
You gotta be ready to use it in broad day
You know little bro will
[Outro: G Herbo]
Ayy, G Herbo 150 dream team, bitch, shout out Coach
Lil Boat, what up?6Embed

For Hot 97 Lyrics[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Brrr
Hey, RD bruh, it's Boat, yeah
Hey man you know that nigga Yachty that went on the God damn mornin' show
Niggas try to freestyle
Niggas tryna act like a nigga ain't got it
Like a nigga ain't still got it
Like a nigga ain't really countin' up hundred dollar bills every motherfuckin' day
Like I ain't bossed up bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Stop all that flexin'
Woke up all my niggas, like stop all that restin'
Might have my OG comin' do a little pressing
You niggas is pussy
I see it, I feel it, I know it, I smell it, it's clear
Fuck I look like sippin' beer?
I got 32 bitches back home waitin' on me
Give 32 fucks to a nigga hatin' on me
Got so much ice you'd think my jeweler flaked on me, God damn
Hold on, money so old, check his colon
Knot so fat Ben Franklin like who is you foldin'
Whips so new got these coppers thinkin' it's stolen
So they pull me over and see my teeth golden
It's over, bro keep the chopper on his shoulder
Just paid cash for a Benz, and Moms, a new Rover
Still the youngest nigga sober
Still the richest nigga over on my side of town
I'm still the king with the crown
King of the teens
Show some respect and bow down
Nigga talkin' crazy, he get shot down
Ay, ooh, yeah, ay, ah
How many times I'ma tell ya?
Young nigga I told ya, I told ya, I told ya
I told ya that RD up next
I told you that Boat keep a check
That Yachty could flex, lil bitch
Watch how I flip it
These niggas get mad cause that weight, I just skipped it
Overnight shawty, that pussy, I dipped it
I had to slow it down cause niggas don't get it
Watch how I do it and watch how I did it
Just copped a new watch and, oh boy, have I shitted
Richer than ever
More wise and more clever
Ball so hard I need a letter, put that on my sweater
Lil bitch, lil bitch
Lil nigga, you hate how I switched
26 shit, I dropped that on my wrist
I'm the richest out the group, just like Kris Jenner
All of these niggas beginners
Fuck on that bitch then I skrrt off with spinners in spinners
All of my whips got spinners
Lil Boat, Lil Boat
[Verse 2: JBan$2Turnt]
JBan$, JBan$
Bitch, stop all that flexin'
Spent 10 on my necklace
Name droppin', we pressure
Bitch don't want no pressure
Eat pussy for breakfast
That bitch actin' reckless, drop her off in Texas
My plug, he like Messi
Got bricks out like sushi, nigga you a rookie
Empire, no Cookie
Saw his chain and I took it
Catch you off in traffic, bitch don't want no static
Then don't play like Magic lil bitch
I ball like I'm Kobe but it's 20, Ginobili
My niggas not foldin', talk down, cut you open
My neck is on frozen, Olaf
He put diamonds forever
We shinin', JBan$, he might blind ya, bitch
Talk down and we find ya, bitch
JBan$ keep that iron, bitch
October 30th like Mike Myers, bitch
G-wagon sit on the big tires, bitch
Bitch, bitch, JBan$

[Verse 3: Byou]
Never, never, never, never
Never ate the box like RD and Jimmy
I shoot with the semi, one eye like I’m Fetty
I look out the scope, just give me the scoop
Whenever you ready, his chest like spaghetti
That nigga gon' fold just like a futon
Would tell her jump on my dick but it's too long
I just bought a bunch of groupies with Groupon
Tell me what you want?
Told 'em, told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em
Hey, hey, I told 'em, I told 'em
Hey, I keep the chrome in my jeans
Hey, just like a chromosome
Hey, popped it with calicorn
Hey, when I get on, I'ma fuck me a Capricorn
Hey, yuh, yuh, ah, ah
Chubba!
[Verse 4: BigBruthaChubba]
All of my whips got spinners
Chop the brick in half like it's the winter, December
Put ah nigga in a blender
All these niggas be pretenders
Pretendin', pretendin'
These niggas ain't winnin'
We still on that mission to get all the blue cheese
We got them clips just like a movie
She suck me up just like a smoothie

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Pussy so gooey, she lick me up after she do me
It's Boat from the Sixer, I'm cut like some scissors
I'm gone off the sizzurp, I hit her from the back
Then hit on that back like she bizzurp
Eat on that pussy like it was some dessert
Minister, sailing team, take him to chizzurch
I don't fuck with these niggas, these niggas be snitches
They just want my riches, they just wanna fuck on my bitches
These niggas, they can't
These niggas be jank
I might pull up with a sword like I was Link
Pull up with a sword like 21
Hit the strip club and throw bands just for fun

Forever Young Lyrics[Verse 1]
All night I've been watching you
So tonight, you're leaving with me
I've been waiting my whole life to give you it all
It's on now, it's on now
I'm talking the big fancy lights
The star studded nights with me
We forever young
We forever young
We forever young

[Pre-Chorus]
The music's loud and I'm feeling wild
Come dance along with the golden child
I don't know much but sure, let me check your fouls
Two technicals but you beautiful
You grew up 6 brothers in a cubicle
And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses
[Chorus]
But we could be together forever
But we could be together forever and ever
I wanna live life with you forever and ever
Together
Forever young
Forever young
We forever young

[Verse 2]
Shining bright under the shining sun
Like moonshine you keep it 99% with me
I'm feeling all your energy
I know you love to vibe with me
I know you love to ride for me
Your favorite thing to say is, "Boat, I love when you're inside of me"
Your love is like a high to me
I love to go out my way to make sure you stay happy
We forever young

[Pre-Chorus]
The music's loud and I'm feeling wild
Come dance along with the golden child
I don't know much but sure, let me check your fouls
Two technicals but you beautiful
You grew up 6 brothers in a cubicle
And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses
[Chorus]
But we could be together forever
But we could be together forever and ever
I wanna live life with you forever and ever
Together
Forever young
Forever young

Forever young, forever young
Forever young, forever young
We forever young11Embed

Better Lyrics[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
Oh, you say it's good
I say it's great
But it could be better
It always could always be better
You say it's good
But it could be better
It always could always be better
Everything in life could always be better
Don't settle for less 'cause then you miss out on more
Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause you say it's good, but it could be better
It always could always be better
Unlock your happiness and live for forever
I'll express my life in a letter
I love you 'cause you be makin' me better
You make me feel so much better
It could be good
But it could be better
When I'm with you, I feel much better
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Let's lay on the hood and look at the stars
And name them whatever
You always call that one Trevor
Since a young one you've always been clever
Let's grow old, rocking chairs and play checkers
I wanna spend my whole life with you
Without you I feel so blue
I probably lose my train of to dos
All my life I always knew

[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
You say it's good
I say it's great
But it could be better
It always could always be better
You say it's good
But it could be better
It always could always be better
Everything in life could always be better
Don't settle for less 'cause then you miss out on more
Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Verse 2: Stefflon Don]
You said I love ya with those eyes so deep
The love you gave me made me feel so sweet
Baby you against the car, you don't deny me
Love the way you love me, I really love you
They must be blind if they can't see
I'll pour it up, I'll take you high
You so fly
Neighbors always come around
When you got me raining down
[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
You say it's good
I say it's great
But it could be better
It always could always be better
You say it's good
But it could be better
It always could always be better
Everything in life could always be better
Don't settle for less 'cause then you miss out on more
Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause you say it's good, but it could be better
It always could always be better
Unlock your happiness and live for forever
I'll express my life in a letter
I love you 'cause you be makin' me better
You make me feel so much better
It could be good
But it could be better
When I'm with you, I feel much better
Oh, oh, oh6Embed
