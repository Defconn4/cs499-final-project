Look at Me Now Lyrics[Intro: Chris Brown]
I don't see how you can hate from outside of the club
You can't even get in!
Hahaha
Leggo

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupée
I get what you get in ten years in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said "On my dick"
I ain't really mean to say "On my dick"
But since we talkin' about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref'
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doin' this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it (Have it)
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit
No, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with an elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said "shoot 'em", and I said "okay"
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, "¡Olé!"
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
(Nope) Not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, "Fuck trial"
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Haha! Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Haha! Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Okay
Okay

I seen how you did homeboy, so please take it easy (No, yeah)
Good to have me on your side, I ain't sayin' that you need me (Yeah, yeah)
Six God talk but I ain't tryna get preachy (No, no, no)

Privacy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I need your body in ways
That you don't understand, but I'm losing my patience
'Cause we've been going over and over again
Girl, I just wanna take you home and get right to it
Know I gotta kiss it, baby
Give it to me, lick it lick it inside and out
You know that I just wanna make love
Want you to scream and shout
And baby, when I'm deep in it now
I'ma slow it down, 'cause ain't no speed limit
When we're moving at the speed of sound
We gon' turn all the way up when the lights down
Why your pussy so damn good, miss lady?
Go and put that booty up, baby, one on one
You know I'ma go crazy when your legs in the air
You know your panties never getting in the way
You know I kinda like it, when you make me work for it
[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom)

No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Licking your private parts (Boom shakalacka, hahaha)
And I know you love your privacy

[Verse 2]
You don't need a shower, you already wet
Know that pussy power, telling me, I ain't ready yet
I say, "Fuck it," face my fears, baby
When I lick it, I put tears in it
Put my face in it, eat it like a dinner date
You know I love foreplay, 12 play, everything
Know my lovin' don't change
I don't really give a fuck what a hater say
'Cause you fine, baby
And it's alright 'cause you're all mine, baby, ooh, hoo
Girl, I'ma let you get crazy

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door

[Verse 3]
Baby, I promise I won’t tell nobody
Just long as you let me hit it like every night
I could give a fuck ‘bout the club, 'cause that pussy tight
Do a split on it, drop it, baby, show you right
I'ma split your weave and you askin' me to stay the night
Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice
Oh my God, oh my God, my bitch get me right
Ain't gotta pay for that pussy, my dick can change your life
I'm tired of missionary, wanna see you on your face

Damn, on your side, on your side
Stop runnin' from this dick, I ain't 'bout to let you slide this time

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
If you leave this time, I fear that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
It seems that you're the only reason for it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God, he must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked (And I poked)
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more (Some more)
And in my notepad, man, I wrote (Man, I wrote)
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip, then a toe tag is one last, I'ma hope (I'ma hope)
So iceberg don't float (Don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite
Still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day, it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God, you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face
And it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish, just stay planted
'Cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think, if it had sunk Titanic
The fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Bitch, you outta line, why you waste my time?
I'm tryna smoke, tryna get high, see it in my eyes
I know she playin' both sides, that bitch tellin' lies
But my dick give her a high, she down for the ride
Them hatin' bitches kill the vibe, fuck it, live your life
Bad bitches in Hawaii, umbrella with ice
10 bad bitches on my side, make 'em all my wife
Smokin' on the finest ganja, she like China white
Poppin' all these pills she said she used to it
She wanna go way up, okay baby, if you used to it
And I know that you a grown woman
And I know that you know what you're doing

Really wanna be faithful but this shit hard, baby
Yup, I got the pussy first and then I ignored you (Ignored you)
You fucked another nigga, you ain't loyal (Loyal)
I told you bring a friend, this shit gettin' borin' (Borin')
She asked me what we are, we just cordial
I'm a gangsta I can make a wet, wet turn into a pool (Splash)
She help me count the money in the trap then she go back to school (School, school, school)
If a nigga ever play with bae, shit it's breaking news (Pow)

I get money when I want, I can fuck her if I want
Baby, you can take it off, I'm that nigga with the sauce (Ayy, yeah)
Whole lot of Saint Laurent, can't remember what it cost (Ayy, yeah)
Bitch, I'm feelin' like a boss, spit on it and lick it off (Ayy, yeah)
You know we can run it up, tell me what you really want
I know I can break you off, come and let me break you off
If you ever wanna fuck, can I be the one you call?
If you wanna be a star, I can tell you what it cost

Grass Ain’t Greener Lyrics[Verse 1]
You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I’m not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a hoe and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
'Less I know for sure that you're vibing with me
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side, I've been there
Oh yeah, I've been there
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
My homie said I need to stop it
My momma said bitches be watchin' you
They gon' put their hand all in your pocket
For the credit card that's in your wallet
Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin'
Calculatin' all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
'Cause she want that tax every month, woo
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity
Keeping it 100 ain't your forté
You used to be
[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah74Embed

Deuces (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture (Oh, oh, oh)
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah, woah)
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up
[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace
[Verse 4: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two-ish? You ain't gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better
[Interlude: Chris Brown & Drake]
So you gonna diss me
Even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gon' miss me a little when I’m gone

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
Drizzy voice
Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper
Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper (Nice)
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!

[Verse 7: Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)
Got a racin' Lamborghini, have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin' ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame (Ugh!)
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself

[Verse 8: Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her61Embed

Lil mama booty boomin', that bitch movin' and she standin' still
I know these bitches choosin' me, but I got 80 on me still
I'm tryna fuck, who tryna chill? 'Cause I'm just tryna pay some bills
I'm multi millionare LaFlare, this watch here cost a quarter M
Just look at me and look at them, I smashed her on my first attempt

[Verse 2: Tyga, Chris Brown]
Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But, baby, I think it's better if I let you know

Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me déjà vu
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

Zero Lyrics[Verse 1]
I thought we were great
You took your love back and ran us off track
I counted all the days
'Til you would come back, how stupid was that?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're missing what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feeling back
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned and run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give, oh
[Verse 2]
Wake up with a dime
Get up to no good, get up and you could
Go out, free our minds
Like you never would, never understood

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now you're missing what we used to have
You been creeping 'round my Instagram
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned to run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I’ve been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give

[Bridge]
Broke back then but a nigga rich now
Got dollars, got euros, got yen, I got pounds, zeros, zeros
Calling me up ‘cause your bad check bounced
My new chick one hundred, and she got her own dinero, zero
You think I'm thinking 'bout your ass?
[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned to run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I’ve been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)

Don’t Check on Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Chris Brown, with Ink]
If I'm out at the bar havin' a night on the town
Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, "Hi"? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time
[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity
Don't check on me

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, with Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you
[Verse 3: Chris Brown, with Ink]
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Ink & Justin Bieber]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June54Embed

Don’t Judge Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
Damn, why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body when you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful
[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful (Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Everything I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)
You're beautiful, so baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(So baby)
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful
[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am (Take me as I am) and not who I was (Not who I was)
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
So please don't judge me (Don't judge me)
And I won't judge you (And I won't 'cause)
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you (No, I won't)
And if you love me (If you love me), then let it be beautiful, babe

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh, ooh)
Let it be beautiful (Let it)
Let it be, oh
Let it be beautiful, ayy
Let it be beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
I don't wanna go there, baby (Be there)
We should never go there (Oh)73Embed
